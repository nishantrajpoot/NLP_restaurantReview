Hoofdgerechten worden geserveerd op koude borden en is meer een portie voor kinderen dan voor volwassenen.Prijzen zijn veel te hoog voor de kleine gerechten die je geserveerd krijgt, wij zijn allemaal met honger weggegaan. Restaurant is niet aan te raden! "

zomato,eng,1,food,"I am surprised the reviews on Zomato are low, it's easily a 4+ restaurant. They have a very interesting type Indian food in tapas style with a modern twist. The portion sizes are small as with tapas. The presentation is nice and the food tasted good. I have been a few times to the place and always left happy."
zomato,por,-1,experience,"Talvez pelas expectativas serem tão altas, que nos foram tão defraudadas. Jantamos num sábado à noite, e o ambiente era maioritariamente preenchido por estrangeiros. A carta oferece uma variedade razoável de pratos portugueses e espanhóis, e é para partilhar. Pedimos a tortilha, que veio ao ponto, ou seja, pouco “cuajada”, mas as batatas estavam duras e a tortilha fria e sem tempero. Depois veio o bacalhau à Brás, igualmente frio e sem tempero, onde o bacalhau nem se via... A seguir veio o polvo, tenro, mas mais uma vez, frio e quase sem tempero. A sobremesa foi uma experiência positiva, e embora não sentíssemos que torrão de amêndoa combinasse com o gelado de limão bastante ácido, gostamos dos sabores separadamente.  Não é para repetir porque não nos surpreendeu em nada e em nenhum prato houve o factor “Uau” que nos fizesse querer voltar para experimentar o resto da carta!  Quanto ao ambiente não achamos acolhedor. Parece que montaram o restaurante no rés-do-chão de um prédio dos anos 60 e aproveitaram o chão e o revestimento das paredes, onde nada combina com nada em termos de materiais. No entanto, damos mais valor à experiência sensorial da comida, e essa, como já referi foi sofrível."
zomato,por,1,experience;consistency;service;value;food,Hambúrguer é sempre bom. Confesso já ter tido uma experiência ruim com o serviço mas em geral não deixa nada a desejar. Bons hambúrgueres e um espaço justo. Preços também. Vale a pena pedir o de carne dupla (se quiser sair da linha)
zomato,por,1,experience;consistency;service;convenience;value,"Sou fã da hamburgueria do bairro! Sempre achei que conseguiam apresentar uma qualidade de hambúrgueres superior à média, apesar dos preços baixos e espaços por vezes reduzidos.  A de São Bento não é excepção, atendimento rápido e simpático, hambúrgueres bem confeccionados e localização conveniente.  Os hambúrgueres com a melhor relação qualidade preço de Lisboa para mim!"
zomato,por,1,value;consistency,"(3.5) Se apetece um bom hambúrguer mas não apetece pagar preços de haute cuisine, a Hamburgueria do Bairro está aí para ajudar. Desde há anos a servir 160 gr brutos de boa carne, batatas bem fritas e maionese de alho viciante, o passar do tempo e a expansão da rede fez dela parte da paisagem nos bairros de Lisboa, um hábito de muitos e talvez por isso menos especial. Mas é de ressalvar a consistência e confiança que mantém: quando tantos tentaram e falharam nesta história dos hamburgueres artesanais xpto, aqui é sempre garantido o almoço rápido e saboroso, o jantar prático e guloso."

zomato,por,1,experience;service;food,"Sempre que apetece um bom hamburguer, é o sítio a visitar! Nunca me arrependo, seja sem pão, com batata frita doce ou normal, o sabor é sempre divinal, guloso e diferente. O espaço é pequeno mas faz parte do 'charme' do sítio. :-)  Recomendo pelo serviço rápido e pela simpatia de todos os que lá trabalham."

zomato,por,1,service;consistency;food,"Domingo à noite e já fora de horas, sem jantar planeado acabámos num dos clássicos: o ponto de partida da Portugália. Se a chegada próxima da hora de fecho sugeria um serviço desleixado, o Sr. Luís Marques certificou-se do contrário e, parafraseando o próprio, cumpriu a sua missão de sairmos mais satisfeitos do que entrámos. Aceitámos a sugestão e optámos pelo pica pau. Não desiludiu. Mesmo a más horas mantiveram o serviço personalizado e a qualidade que os caracteriza."

Óptimo para uma refeição rápida, em 10/15 minutos a comida é servida."

zomato,por,1,food;service,O h3 no Colombo tem bastante afluência. A ganhar cada vez mais adeptos por apresentar várias opções mais saudáveis que hambúrguer no pão e ao mesmo tempp oferecer um serviço rápido. Sou fã das batatas da h3 e do hambúrguer tuga.
zomato,por,1,experience;service;environment,"Se for ao jantar é preciso ter um bocado paciência para aguardar pela mesa, é um sitio giro e a comida é boa mas acho pequeno para a quantidade de pessoas que lá vão. As batatas fritas são maravilhosas, pena ter reformulado a ementa e terem tirado o hambúrguer de tofu."

zomato,por,1,experience;food;service,"Espaço bem decorado, com uma zona exterior bastante agradável. A comida é boa, mas ganham os cocktails.

No fundo, junto com a imensa quantidade de molho, estavam os legumes. Comi as fatias de frango e um pouco do arroz. É, de certeza, um prato a não repetir."
zomato,por,0,experience;service,"De um modo geral é realmente muito bom. A qualidade da carne, o arroz... mas nas entregas através da app simplesmente entregam as sobremesas congeladas ao cliente. Quando contactado atraves das redes sociais nem respota dão."
zomato,por,-1,service;value,"Qualidade de serviço muito fraca. Falta de organização na cozinha. Fiz o pedido em conjunto com o meu namorado, recebi logo o meu prato mas tivemos 15 minutos à espera do 2 prato só porque ele pediu médio-mal passado. Ainda tiveram a lata de servir dois clientes os seus pratos antes de nos servirem a nós. A empregada do balcão respondeu-nos de forma rude e o meu prato acabou por ficar frio e o dele nem veio menos passado que o meu que era médio. As batatas estavam super gordurosas e moles e serviram-nos doses relativamente pequenas de arroz."
zomato,por,1,experience;value,"Fui ao Jamie's Italian num sábado à noite. O atendimento pareceu-me um bocado a despachar, mas em contrapartida os ravioli com porcini que pedi estavam divinais, à semelhança da sobremesa, que é deliciosa. Só o ultimate garlic bread deixou um pouco a desejar."
zomato,por,1,experience;value;reputation;food;consistency,Sempre um clássico como já nos habituou a qualidade dos restaurantes portugalia. As doses podiam ser mais generosas. A cerveja sempre fresca e a carne tenra. Tudo o que se pode pedir de uma Portugalia. A ir caso se esteja perto
zomato,por,1,experience;value;food;environment,Restaurante com ótima qualidade preço. Pedi para levar porque queria comer ao sol (inconveniente não ter esplanada)  Empregados muito atenciosos Aconselho vivamente o Camone e limonada!

zomato,por,0,service;food,Visitei o Tapisco num jantar de amigos. Fomos bem recebidos e optamos por partilhar alguns pratos da carta. Comida saborosa no entanto serviço um pouco demorado.
zomato,por,1,experience;service;food,"Já fui 2 vezes a este restaurante e achei a comida óptima! Da primeira vez pedi a Pizza Diavola e estava fantástica! Da segunda vez, fui a um aniversário e pedi uma salada pois estava a fazer uma dieta restritiva na altura e, apesar da salada estar óptima, achei uma grande falta de flexibilidade por parte da cozinha e do staff. Inclusive, quando a salada chegou o empregado disse “foi a senhora que pediu uma salada quase sem nada?!?”. Fiquei um pouco perplexa, pois alem de apenas não ter pedido queijo e bacon, acho q não há necessidade deste tipo de comentário e o que interessa é o cliente estar satisfeito."
zomato,por,1,experience;food;service;value,"Esta foi a primeira casa Portugália que conheci, e continua a ser a que mais gosto de voltar. Sempre fui fã dos seus bifes e especialmente do seu molho que são por norma fantásticos. Desta vez tentei provar algo diferente e não me arrependi. A açorda de camarão estava fantástica e as ameijoas à bulhão pato também. Não foi o serviço mais rápido (que se justifica pela casa cheia) e quanto ao custo médio podia ser um pouco mais baixo, porém a experiência de uma forma geral foi bastante positiva."
zomato,por,-1,experience;service;value,"Jantar a 2 num restaurante que tem sido falado por bons motivos, no entanto foi algo dececionante. O espaço é acolhedor e moderno mas com as pessoas sentadas quase umas em cima das outras. E não havia necessidade se houvesse disponibilidade do Stags em possibilitar o acesso a outra sala, uma vez que o restaurante até é grande. Tive oportunidade de experimentar uma pizza é uma massa. As pizzas são cozidas a lenha, mas não deslumbram nem pelo preço, pelo contrário. A massa estava boa e os ingredientes eram excelentes(esparguete com camarões). Os sumos não alcoólicos aconselha-se. O serviço é lento e algo desorganizado. Nesta gama de preços espera-se e exige-se mais."
zomato,por,1,experience;value;food,Pizzas com bons ingredientes e sabores muito variados. Não são as pizzas de massa alta como em Nápoles mas são deliciosas à mesma! O preço é um puxado
zomato,por,1,experience;environment;service,"Gostei muito do espaço, tinha um bom ambiente e uma decoração fantástica. Pedimos a pizza Prosciutto Arrosto e Funghi e o calzoni clássico. Ambos estavam uma delícia. Foi uma pena não terem sangria, mas também já visitamos o restaurante um pouco tarde próximo da hora de fecho. Os funcionários eram bastante acessíveis. Sem dúvida que recomendo."
zomato,por,1,experience;consistency;food;service;environment,"A paella do Tapisco é bastante diferente das paellas espanholas a que estamos acostumados, principalmente por o arroz ser diferente, contudo, tem uma excelente qualidade e um marisco 5 estrelas, sendo uma excelente opção a apostar para quem gosta de comer bem e com qualidade. O espaço é giro e o atendimento bastante simpático, recomendo :)"
zomato,por,1,convenience;food,"Depois de 45 minutos de espera, conseguimos ter uma mesa no restaurante. As entradas estavam muito saborasos. O pato pequim estava bom e a sopa de caril amarelo estava perfeita."
zomato,por,-1,food,"Todos falam tão bem deste restaurante, que tive que experimentar. Não sei se não pedi os pratos certos, mas não fiquei realmente surpreendida com nada. Quero voltar outra vez para obter a experiência incrível que já ouvi várias pessoas a dizer que tiveram."
zomato,por,1,service;environment;experience;food;reputation,Talvez o meu restaurante de eleição. O atendimento é incrível e para a comida não há palavras para descreve-la. Desde as entradas as sobremesas. O staff é muito atencioso. O ambiente é incrível. Um verdadeira viagem à Ásia. Obrigada!
zomato,por,-1,service;experience,"Começando pela recepção até ao final foi uma enorme desilusão. Na recepção a hostess começou logo por dizer de forma muito pouco simpática “temos mesa na esplanada mas se chover não repomos nem comida nem bebida” . Massa das pizzas banal, pizza de presente e figo enjoativa, pizza trufa sem sabor, carbonara a saber demasiado a ovo, Margarita com molho de tomate sem sabor. Serviço pouco simpático. Uma enorme desilusão."
zomato,por,1,food,"O melhor restaurante asiático de Lisboa! O prato que todos devem pedir é o excelente Caril de Frango com molho de coco ou o Pad Thai de camarão tigre. Sempre que visitou o Boa Bao fico feliz, e super satisfeita!"
zomato,por,-1,service;reputation,"Provavelmente uma das piores experiências num restaurante que tive. Esperamos mais de uma hora na rua para ter uma mesa (apesar da previsão de 20min que nos foi dada). Sentamo-nos e quando começamos a escolher deparamo-nos com algumas dúvidas sobre o nome de alguns ingredientes e pedimos ajuda à empregada que nos estava a atender e que não nos soube responder a nada, não conhecia nem as pizzas e muito menos os ingredientes que estas continham para nos conseguir ajudar. A cada questão tinha de correr à cozinha para perguntar ao chefe. Pedimos então de 4 pizzas duas com menos um ingrediente cada (enchidos, neste caso) . O pedido foi para a cozinha e uns minutos depois a empregada retorna a dizer que se tinha enganado e que afinal os ingredientes não eram o que nos tinha dito no primeiro instante, confirmamos o que queriamos uma vez mais, focando na parte de que não queriamos enchidos e reforçamos a pergunta se não teria, o que nos foi dito que não, eram apenas aqueles ingredientes em específico. As pizzas vieram e, uma delas, com o dito enchido que tinha sido pedido para retirar, tivemos de voltar a chamar a empregada e pedir que a pizza fosse trocada e voltamos a referir que era uma pizza exactamente igual sem os enchidos. Desta vez retorna outro empregado à nossa mesa a dizer que se não queriamos enchidos teriamos de ser obrigados a pedir uma pizza vegetariana. Achamos hilariante e voltamos a reforçar que queríamos apenas a pizza sem o ingrediante específico que era o enchido. A pizza chegou finalmente , quando a restantes pessoas estavam quase a terminar as suas, e quando achamos que seria esta que viria decente, o ragu  que a pizza continha vinha frio (a pizza em questao era uma calzone Franschini). Comemos a pizza mesmo assim cansados do mau atendimento, da espera, de um pedido simples como tirar um ingrediante. O mais inadmissível aqui é que estamos a falar de uma pizza com um custo de 19 euros, não é um preço nem barato nem médio e deveria servir para ter uma pizza de topo. Pedimos as sobremesa, que salvaram o jantar, uma vez que duas das pizzas eram apenas razoáveis e uma tinha conteúdo frio. Pedimos por final a conta e procedemos ao pagamento achando que seria impossível esta experiência piorar, mas a verdade é que foi possível. Perguntamos se era possível dividir a fatura, visto que eramos dois casais, e pedimos que fossem passadas duas faturas com NIFs distintos. Foi-nos dito que sim e apontados os NIFs. O cúmulo foi mesmo que retornou uma fatura sem qualquer NIF. Voltamos a reforçar que queríamos as faturas e a empregada apenas nos disse que agora já nada podia fazer, a conta já tinha sido fechada. Apenas não insitimos mais cansados de tão mau serviço e tamanha incompetência, mas o que deveriamos mesmo ter feito era uma reclamação local no livro de reclamações. Toda esta situação é inadmissível e impensável, num restaurante com tanta fama, tão bem cotado e que ansiavamos experimentar e que, sem dúvida, não recomendaremos a ninguém, muito pelo contrário."
zomato,por,1,food,"Situado numa das minhas zonas preferidas de Lisboa, este estaminé tem uma oferta diversa mas não excessiva (desconfio sempre de pratos a mais) de petiscos deliciosos, de que terei de destacar a salada de polvo e um dos melhores chocos fritos que o meu pato já provou."

zomato,por,1,environment,"A Zero Zero iniciou a nova vaga de pizzarias em Lisboa e continua a liderar o leque de estabelecimentos da especialidade. Desta feita visitei o espaço do Príncipe Real e adorei o ambiente. A área exterior é bem mais charmosa do que a interior com trepadeiras típicas dos vilarejos italianos. Optámos por comer uma burrata e a pizza de tartufo e pecorino. Não sou grande fã de trufa negra mas soube-me muito bem. A minha perdição é a trufa branca, o óleo da trufa e espero que um dia possam fazer uma pizza especial com esta iguaria. Experimentei pela primeira vez o badalado Aperol Spritz mas não fiquei fã. Aconselho a visita, o Zero a Zero é uma óptima opção, sempre!!!!"
zomato,por,1,food;environment,"Este restaurante é muito espaçoso e agradável tanto dentro como na esplanada. Gostaria que a pizza de cogumelos tivesse mais sabor e temperos, achei muito banal. Achei as pizzas demasiado grandes."
zomato,eng,0,experience;convenience;environment;service;value,It's located in a nice place. The restaurant has nice decorations and staff is polite. My major reason for giving 2 stars is that I was disappointed by the price versus the food quality. The price of a pizza is too expensive and not that great for the price. In the price range I have better options.
zomato,por,1,food;environment,"Consistência é o que se procura quando visitamos a Padaria Portuguesa, os menus que já conhecemos, os produtos de padaria que conhecemos. Esta esplanada é muito bem aproveitada nesta localização, óptimo para um lanche numa tarde de verão."
zomato,por,1,food;environment,"Mais uma Padaria Portuguesa, que tem uma localização muito boa, uma vez que se coloca numa zona de muita movimentação empresarial/ laboral, mas também turística. Tem a mesma qualidade das demais e embora o espaço possa ter uma decoração mais simplista, é perfeitamente compensada pela esplanada e serviço simpático."

zomato,por,1,food,"Um espaço giríssimo e muito bem adornado no Príncipe Real. Já conquistou o coração e o estômago desta Portuense 😅. Pedi a penne com molho de tomate e estava deliciosa! A sobremesa, um mil folhas recheado de caramelo salgado acompanhado de um gelado e um crocante de pistacho, era de comer e de chorar por mais! As pizzas também estavam soberbas e os cocktails não desiludiram. Recomendo 👌👏"

zomato,eng,-1,consistency,"When you think about eating healthy and good in a nice Place, Amélia could be a good suggestion. In general the brunch was good, the atmosphere was pleasant and the waiters were kind.   Regarding the food the only things we can suggest is adding a bit of lemon to the avocado toast to give it a zesty touch that combines perfectly with the salty fluffiness of the bread and the creamy avocado.   We loved the crunchiness of the bread on the outside and when you bite it you can taste and feel how fresh it it. The pancakes could be a bit less crunchy on the outside because when it starts getting cold and you mix it with the maple syrup can be difficult to cut and eat, however the taste is amazing.   The granola with fruits was really good but if they add a bit less of cinnamon, you can taste better the rest of the ingredients.   In general terms we totally recommend it for small groups and couple but as a lot of families go there with kids, it could a bit uncomfortable if you wanna have a chill Sunday brunch.   Thank you guys for the great service you offer us today! 😁"

tripadvisor,eng,-1,reputation;food,"This restaurant is just off Oxford Street close to Selfridges. The menu has all the classic dishes. The olives as an appetiser were good, but i wouldnt recommend the crescenti- they seemed no more than small pieces of pizza dough to me. The veal with spaghetti was bland, the veal a bit dry perhaps because it was very thin. The lasagne was a large portion and piping hot which makes a pleasant change because so often it is not heated through properly. All in all not a memorable meal."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,food;consistency,"We went again to the Spaghetti house after a year from our first visits (a very good experience last May) and while bolognese was good and a decent quality, my pasta with clams and seafood was absolutely row, not cooked at all. I could have sensed a chef changing as the taste was not as same as lat year. A shame really, I like good quality Italian food but I think the next time we will try to look for a different place."

We sat at our table ordered our food and drink and moments later our drinks arrived, I'm sorry to say the gin and tonic didn't taste too good and I can only guess it was watered down or something else suspicious, now I know I should have complained but as I said it was late and I couldn't be bothered. Shortly after our food arrived and it was really nice, it tasted fresh and was really well flavoured but because of the drinks we decided to not have desert or another drink and just paid the bill and just left. Now I don't want to be harsh because I realise the owner may not know he has a bad bottle of gin and me not complaining at the time doesn't help, but the food was tasty and the waitress was really pleasant."

Bij ons waren ze wel snel, maar ze waren niet op de hoogte van de ingrediënten van hun burgers. @Jilles mocht je dit lezen: als je van alle burgers een allergielijst kan toevoegen, neem dan ook die van het slaatje met saus op.Interieur is echt super, maar als je begon rond te kijken zag je toch in de hoeken enkele spinnenwebben.Burgers waren zeer lekker van smaak, maar het vlees zelf was zeer uitgedroogd. Alsof je ze zou opwarmen in de microgolf (je kent het wel: zo'n droog korstje). Dit terzijde valt de prijs van de burgers mee (startprijs rond 15 euro tot 19 euro), het drinken daarentegen... Als water al evenveel kost als een alcoholisch bier... (maar liefst 3,5 euro voor water). De onion rings zijn trouwens een van de betere die ik al heb gegeten, maar wel zeer vettig. Borden hebben duidelijk ook hun beste tijd gehad; van de 3 borden die wij kregen was er uit elk bord 3-4 stukken. En geen klein stukje, nee een stukken van 2cm. Als het lukt, reserveer dan niet om half 9. Het restaurant sluit om 9u en dan komen zo ook rond om dit te zeggen zeggen. Snel eten is de boodschap dan!"

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;value;food,I was looking forward to going to Middletons as a relatively new restaurant in town. I ordered the seafood mixed grill and the fish was great but let down by the jacket potato which had clearly been microwaved. General opinion was that it is quite overpriced for the quality of the food and there is better restaurants in town.

tripadvisor,fra,-1,food;service,"N’ayant jamais été au Ellis Burger, j’ai décidé de m’y rendre avec des amies par un temps ensoleillé. Nous étions assises en terrasse, sur la place. Après avoir commandé nos plats, les calamars sont arrivés près de 20 Minutes après alors que nous avions fait part au serveur qu’il s’agissait de plats pour certains, on s’attendait donc à ce que tout arrive en même temps. Les verres étant vieux et sales, je demande alors une paille au serveur, paille qui m’est refusée! Je ne peux pas boire dans un verre ou 45 personnes ont bu le jour même, alors soit vous proposez des pailles en carton, soit le resto ne possède pas de pailles du tout mais le serveur n’a pas à exposer ses opinions politiques. Nos Burger sont arrivés 45 minutes après les calamars ! Le soleil s’était déjà couché, on a donc mangé, mais c’était sans goût, je pense que c’est l’un des burger les plus fades que j’ai mangé de ma vie (et sans exagération).Vu la réputation de Ellis, je croyais que ça allait être très bon ou du moins correct mais là c’était froid, sans grand intérêt... j’ai payé 15€ pourtant j’avais encore faim apres... en tout cas, je ne reviendrais plus jamais de ma vie ! (Mais le maïs est bon c’est le point positif)"

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;value;food,"Visited this restaurant for a early mother’s day and found the service was very poor and inattentive. Some of the food was Ok, ribs were nice, but the lobster was really poor, small Portion and over cooked to the extent it was rubbery and tasteless. Have driven past this restaurant many times and always looks good from the outside and was looking forward to eating there. However unfortunately for the Middleton I doubt we would bother to return."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;value;food,"I’ve been to this Spaghetti House before and they disappointed me this evening. They were busy but service was very slow (we waited 30 mins to order drinks and our food)- the starter arrived before our drinks. At the end we waited 40 mins to order cheese. In the middle my lasagna was dry, they brought the wrong order for my friend and the tomato and onion salad arrived as we were finishing our food. Not a great experience. They reduced the bill but still wanted to charge for service (what service!?)"

tripadvisor,eng,1,service;food;reputation,"We dined here for lunch and were not disappointed. Service was slow, the servers seemed in no rush to do anything - although not unpleasant I would note! Food wise, we ordered the potato dips to share as a starter - highly recommended!! They were like a chip and a roast potato got triple cooked and had a baby together, covered in cheese and peppers, and served with delicious dips. Burger wise, I had a Bacon Eli (think that was the name) and my boyfriend had a Cheesy Nelson. Both were outstanding, really high quality burgers - not greasy or McDonald’s like at all. We shared a sideOf chips also (good portion siZe to share if you had a big starter also and aren’t starving). The beer recommendations with every burger are a nice touch. My boyfriend went with the recommended choice for his and loved it. Definitely worth a visit when in the area - just maybe not if you are in a rush."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"First time trying this restaurant. Got a walk-in table at around 7.30, even though it was quite busy. Initially good service offering drinks, but these then took a while to arrive. Ordered our food and then had to wait over an hour for it to arrive. When it finally arrived, the food was ok and not badly priced, but we probably wouldn’t return due to the poor service and wait time."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;environment;service;food,"Music way too loud, could barely hear each other. Staff seemed rushed off their feet, dropping glasses often. Barpersons we're throwing empty bottles into the bottle bin right near us so we'd hear a huge CLANG whilst eating.We ate quite late so they must have run out of mushrooms as we all got 2 small button mushrooms with our steaks. The food was still delicious,and our waitress was lovely but super stressed - We go to the Norwich Middleton's loads, it's a much better experience, this Watford branch really let's the brand name down.

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food,Visited Saturday evening for a birthday meal. Enjoyed the steak and the staff were very attentive. Two veggies in our party were adequately catered for and the evening was good value for money. Would certainly visit again on a future trip to Leicester
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;value;food;environment,"This place is overpriced and overrated. No atmosphere/terrible ambience, food is clearly pre-cooked as it arrives so piping hot that it is impossible for it to have been cooked on a spot (eg a carbonara is never boiling - the sauce is cold and the pasta itself is never piping hot). Left us feeling stuffed and nauseous."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;environment;service,"I live in Middleton and visit middletons regularly. I always go with high expectations and am let down by the steak being over cooked and poor service. I know that recently they have been working hard to improve both- and my god has it worked. The past few months it has got better and better, and it was perfect on my last visit. Service was fast and friendly, a really nice atmosphere and a very good selection of food. If you like your steak, the quality of the meat is absolutely exceptional- best I’ve ever eaten. Seasoned perfectly and you can taste the quality of the meat. All the steaks we ordered were cooked to perfection, and the sides and sauces were brilliant too. I recommend the ribs or haddock Goujons to start, and a prime grill or an 8oz fillet for main. Also probably best to book in advance. It’s a must if you like your steak, grills or fish. 10/10"
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"We visited Middletons on Sunday 24th March 2019 to celebrate three birthdays. We were a party of eleven and had booked for a meal at 5pm. The restaurant wasn't busy and we received good service for drinks and starters. When we got to our main course two of our party had ordered the beef Wellington to be served pink. Unfortunately the fillet steak was well done. The staff made apologies on behalf of the chef and took both dishes away stating two new dishes would be ready in eight minutes. Twenty minutes passed and I had to enquire how much longer we had to wait. When the new beef wellingtons were finally served the fillet steak again was not pink but rare. They were again taken back to the chef and put back in the oven. As you can imagine the other nine people of our party had now finished their meal. The beef wellingtons were finally returned, heated through until pink. This was totally not acceptable and ruined what was supposed to be the celebration of three birthdays.Middletons manageress did not charge us for the beef wellingtons or another steak which had not been cooked to order and also gave us 15% off the bill.The food was generally OK but the on duty chef was obviously not up to cooking certain orders of steak. It was a Sunday so maybe the main chef had a day off.Our meal had been spoilt and I will not be rushing back. "
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;value;food;service,"My first time here and it won't be my last. A huge menu and more than just steaks available. The food was superb and every member of staff knew their job and enhanced my enjoyment of the evening. Kimberley, well done. Decent drinks options too and although prices could be considered at the 'dear' end the food was so good it was worth it"
tripadvisor,eng,0,service;food,Not bad but not excellent either. Service is not bad but they should be a bit nicer and more friendly.Good place if you run out of alternatives..
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service;environment,"We received a warm friendly welcome on arrival and were seated straight away in the basement, where the music set a nice relaxed mood. The menu choice is huge, separated, for example, into: Steaks, Grills, Vege, Seafood, Burgers, etc. Almost everything we ordered was excellent, with only one minor issue with a particular dish which was resolved in an extremely polite, friendly and prefessional manner by our lovely hostess, Kayleigh - thank you kindly."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,service;consistency;experience,"Disasterous! they forgot to put our order through, when I enquired about our food they pretended it wasn't to the chef's liking and he was cooking us fresh dishes......we weren't convinced. We were offered 50% off the bill as a result but it ruined our evening.  The staff didn't seem to know who was doing what, or whether customers were satisfied or not."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;food,"Had the steak and sticky combo which was great and the building is amazing, it's just a shame that the service let the side down. The side order of onion rings were forgotten and only half a lobster was sent out instead of a full lobster. It took ages to get a server to help sort the issue out. Once we did we were offered some extra sides but as we had all finished our food already it seemed a bit pointless..."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,service;food,Standard italian fare. The cooking is OK but not very interesting and the service is very indifferent
tripadvisor,eng,1,food,"A year after our first visit, we returned to Ellis as heavy duty shopping had left us feeling in need of a proper lunch. We left it late, so were offered a seat in the rear terrace, which was FAB - properly heated and very comfy. Service was swift and efficient as before, the waiter switching to English at our glazed response to Flemish. Tried their new ""meatlover"" burger. WOW. Properly cooked, nice and juicy, just a little pink in the middle. The salmon burger was also declared excellent. A surprise hit was the homemade strawberry lemonade - with real bits of strawberry in it. And of course the best fries in the universe. Not just for carnivores though - they do a good range of veggie and even vegan burgers. And other stuff - but I stopped looking after I spotted the Meat Lover."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,service;food,"Food: ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️  Service ⭐️⭐️We went to the steakhouse tonight to celebrate a birthday after reading amazing reviews on TA. We met family there who were already seated and I was surprised when we arrived that nobody greeted us at the door, we found the table ourselves and as we passed the bar I noticed it was overflowing with dirty glassware which again, caught my attention and surprised me. After sitting at the table a few minutes, nobody came to see us and I was told the others had asked for children’s menus and none had arrived yet. I went back to the front to collect children’s menus my self and had to wait several minutes to get someone’s attention, it seemed to me at this point that maybe they were short staffed?! All staff seemed to busy in various ways but didn’t seem attentive to customers.We finally ordered drinks and starters but our starters arrived before our drinks and I had to ask for our drinks to be delivered. The starters of calimari, garlic bread and garlic mushrooms were delicious!Our mains eventually arrived and again were delicious, but we barely ever saw our main server, it actually seemed like he was practically avoiding us! The waitress who brought us our main meals was very friendly and I wished she could’ve served us. We’re not in a hurry to return which is unfortunate because our meals were very tasty.The restaurant was NOT busy when we arrived, there were plenty of tables filled, but that wouldn’t be enough to make the service as poor as it was. I wish we would’ve conplained to the manager when we were there, however it was very busy when we left."

They change the filling and you can choose salad or mashed potatoes. Staff was very attentive explaining how it works. You have water and apples for free in the tables.

We didn't have a start and went all in for the main course. Steak of course. I had a wonderful Fillet Steak. Taste wise fantastic. Seasoning on the outside great. The inside I would have wished a bit more rare but it was Ok. As a side I chose Coleslaw. I know it sounds awkward but that was probably the best Coleslaw I have ever had. It was almost the star of the show. Loved it. They have a good wine selection. We went for red wine Pinot Noir. Perfect with the steak. Staff was very attentive and friendly. It is indeed a great Steakhouse. Fantastic atmosphere, nice people, good food and drinks. Well done. Price wise, living in London, it is more than Ok ;-)"

tripadvisor,fra,1,food;service,"Finalement assez déçu par ce restaurant. L'accueil et le service sont plutôt efficaces, cependant côté nourriture c'est décevant. Le Burger Ellis est bon, mais la viande manque franchement de goût, alors que le pain devient trop rapidement imbibé avec le jus de cuisson.Les frites quant a elles sont bonnes et bien cuites.Un point important: dans le kid menu à 9 euros (burger + dessert + frites) le burger est de taille franchement trop petit. Pour un enfant de 8 ans c'est une entrée, pas un plat principal.Donc un restaurant, avec un service efficace, mais côté goût c'est vraiment trop juste."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"Although the restaurant was not busy, everything took an age to arrive, including drinks throughout the meal. One of the starters was incorrect, although the staff did make every attempt to rectify their mistake. I’d asked before I’d ordered if there was any butter or oil on the vegetable sides (as I didn’t want any) and was assured there wouldn’t be. They arrived glossy! My steak was delicious, blue as I’d ordered it. My husband had asked for his well done, and blackened it certainly was, and one of our friends who’d asked for his medium, left a lot as it was on the very rare side. Not an unpleasant meal or evening, I just don’t think it was worth the prices we paid."

Lisa was our waitress and she was lovely; friendly, knowledgeable, efficient and simply great customer service.

tripadvisor,deu,-1,value;food;environment,"Der Service und das Ambiente versprechen auf den ersten Blick ein gutes Bistro Erlebnis, doch die Speisen können absolut nicht überzeugen. Geschmackloses Essen aus der Tiefkühle zu dann doch recht hohen Preisen. Wir waren leider sehr enttäuscht, sind aber auch der Meinung, dass wenn die Qualität der Speisen angehoben werden kann, dass das Croqino‘s ein tolles Bistro werden kann."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;value,"Food is okay, service fine, building is nice however I found the price of the food and portion size quite shocking. I ordered the Halloumi skewers which you get with 1 side dish for 11.99, when it arrived I had 2 skewers full of peppers and mushrooms with skant halloumi there mjust have been 50p worh of food on them! Along side was a dish with 6 onion rings. For desert I ordered a Baileys and white chocolate cheesecake which was a very small slice at just under £6.00!! It was the oddest cheesecake I ever had very strange consistency bit like wall paper paste thats been standing too long, nothing line cheesecake.  It was average and I felt cheated at the portion size and prices. I would not visit again. I did not order of the set menu which is cheaper and you expect a bit less I ordered off the main menu so was very disappointed. "

Fijn om gratis water of een appel te krijgen, zo hoort het. Eerlijk eten op restaurant = top. Voor service moet je hier niet zo heel veel verwachten, bij een hallo en ik wil dit eten blijft het bij. Op zich niks mis mee, maar het is anders dan gewoonlijk. Je gaat ook geen persoon aan je tafel zien, behalve wanneer ze het gerecht komen brengen."

Starters of mussels and garlic mushrooms were to die for, absolutely delicious, followed by mixed grills - both the meat one and the fish one - the meat was incredible, beautifully seasoned, tasty and tender, and although we enjoyed the fish one aswell, the salmon and sea bass were a little over cooked and dry, we would definitely go back and try it again thoughAll washed down with a couple of bottles of wine and finished off with a gorgeous ‘birthday’ black forest gateaux, al in all was a lovely meal and a lovely evening"

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service,Arrived on semi busy Friday night. Shown to our table promptly. My wife had a nice view but I was just staring at a bleak entrance way. Pot luck I guess Pre meal drinks and food order was quick and efficient My spicy chicken wings were nice but not spicy in my book Mains arrived and before I had even tried a piece of steak I was asked twice how my meal was . Wish they had asked a few mins later as we realised we had been given each other’s by mistake. However the steak ( ribeye and sirloin) were delicious and my wife was impressed with the little side salad . The pepper sauce in my opinion was too bland and gloopy to do the steak justice Ordered a cheese board ( nice selection ) between us to finish the lovely bottle of red we  ordered . When it came to the clearance of the plates we were asked about our meal by our main waitress Summer who has been great all night. We have the above honest feedback which she thanked us for We said we would still come back as overall we had a wonderful night . Bill came and our dessert cost was taken off as a gesture of good will which I thought was I nice and unexpected touch . Will return .
tripadvisor,fra,-1,service;food,"Nous avons attendu 45 min avant que quelqu'un vienne prendre nos commandes (nous avions juste eu les boissons), pourtant nous avons interpellé les serveurs au moins quatre fois. Le restaurant n'était même pas bondé. Une fois la commande passée, celle ci a été servie au moins 30min après, pour des burgers fades et tièdes. Le serveur s'était de plus trompé dans la commande et nous avons reçu le mauvais plat. A la caisse, une serveuse désagréable nous prend de haut et refuse de diviser l'addition. Les prix sont fort elevés pour une qualité si médiocre, tout cela malgré une carte qui semble alléchante."

Would definitely visit again if we were in Multon Keynes. 
tripadvisor,nld,1,experience;service;value;food,De systeem van bestelling was nogal verwarrend. We moesten eerst het eten bestellen aan de toonbank dan pas zitten. Gelukkig kon de man ons een uitleg geven. Hij kon ook in Nederlands spreken en dat was wel een grote pluspunt. Zeker in verfranste Brussel. Het eten was prima. De prijs was wel beetje te duur maar het is wel normaal. Zeker in Brussel. Gelukkig was het water inbegrepen.
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"Given the impressive venue, the food was incredibly unimpressive... oily chicken wings, underseasoned food, super oily and soggy battered haddock with which they didn't even give tartar sauce until asked! The dauphinoise potatoes were odd, i had to leave mine. The skinny burger came with a pathetic little pile of lettuce.... no real salad or replacement for the bun. The desserts were so bad we sent them back.... black forest gateau was in a cup with more cream and yukky syrup than cake. The only positive was the waitress who was attentive, prompt and absolutely lovely throughout. "

Are daughter booked this restaurant.Me being a very fussy steak eater was not sure.But I need mot have worried.I had the 12oz rib eye and it was cooked to perfection as I oreded.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,Food good and price fine too but a poor review because of the cramped seating. Our table was next to another couple a metal screen between us. Felt more like being in prison.The other side was a narrow aisle between the next group of seating. I suppose this maybe necessary to make the business feasible. This is a difficult balance as we won't return. However as the restaurant was rammed it'll do fine without us!
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food,Excellent food and Excellent service.  Martin was great. Very friendly and remembered exactly who had ordered what when bringing food/ drinks to the table
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;environment;food;service,Visited Middletons on Saturday 6th April for a birthday meal. The restaurant was busy with a good atmosphere. We were seated quickly and our waitress Maya was very helpful and knowledgeable. The food came quickly and was tasty and although one of the table had an issue with their steak it was rectified quickly and replaced with no issue. We had a lovely evening and the staff made it even more special. Maya is a credit to the team.
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;value;service,"Good evening,I visited the restaurant yesterday during lunch time. I ordered lasagna bolognese (12.95), pana cotta (5.95) and the bread (4). The pasta did not seem fresh at all and for that price it should be, in my opinion. The portion of the pana cotta was ridiculous, four pounds for frozen bread, come on ... There was not any passion in the food the were serving.The staff were like robbots, correct in their procedure but not friendly at all. When the waiter presented the lasagna, he asked if i would like cheese, however this was reflected in a way that looked forced and robotic, without interest or genuine care. after providing the cheese, I felt almost intimidated to ask for more, as the tone of voice and body language of the waiter was far from friendly.Feel free to see for yourself and determine if you can relate to my experience. A seemingly enjoyable lunch can turn out to be an overpriced mistake.Regards"

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;environment;food;value,"We went to Milton Keynes to go to Gulliver’s land and then wanted a nice dinner after. Being American Im a huge steak fanatic and always eager to try different places.The decor was great, staff was friendly. We went early which was nice but the place filled quickly while we ate.Awesome children’s menu that includes a steak option for kids. Which came out cut already so we absolutely loved that and so did my kids. Its also a fixed price and cheap even including a small dessert. Both our little ones devoured their meals with delight.My spouse ordered a steak/rib combo with scalloped potatoes and she enjoyed it and found the ribs to be very tasty, while not US bbq great, for Europe definitely not bad.Her steak was good and the potatoes were delivered as I snuck a bite or two.My meal was good i had the 12oz sirloin with a baked potato. The baked potato was small bit cooked well. The steak was tasty and good to a perfect medium, but seasoning was lacking. I don’t even think they salt and pepper them before searing which is disappointing. The garlic butter though was key and rescued the steak as i layered it on and enjoyed the flavour it added.I had a baileys cheesecake slice for dessert and enjoyed it very much. My wife had the chocolate  lava cake and loved it as well.Overall a good experience with fair pricing but would highly suggest to season the steaks or at least offer it as an extra. Its amazing how much a little chilli powder/ garlic/ pepper / salt options when added during the cooking process can raise the level of a steak."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,service,"Simply don't waste your time here!They took up our order of 2 Drinks, 2 burgers and nachos to share without even writing it down which made us suspicious. 5 minutes later we got our Drinks so we didn't spend much more thought on it.After 60 minutes we still didn't get our Burgers so we asked how much longer it will take.They told us that they didn't take any order from us other than the 2 Drinks. Instead of offering something as a compensation, they instead gave us a bill for our 2 Drinks and didn't Retake an order for our Food.If someone came to our table, apologised for the unconvenience and offered to take an order with a discounted Price or the nachos for free or whatever, it would have been ok and we still would have eaten our burgers without much complaining...I can only rate the Service and the Service is the most miserable I have ever witnessed in a Restaurant... They were completly overwhelmed and the Restaurant was maybe half full during lunch time.. They forgot orders left and right and they dropped Food, which spilled on the customers. They just gave him a dry kitchen  towel to clean off hot dipping Sauce or chili that has been spilled all over his clothes by one of the Services..Would never recommend anyone to waste their time there, Ostende has so many nice Restaurants to offer! Take a look at them instead!!"

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;environment;food;service,"It was our 2d visit with family/friends dining since the place was opened. I give it 2 stars today only because of the waiting staff , who are really working hard and doing their best, otherwise this place  doesn’t deserve even 1 star. And the reason for that - food and toilets .  In all honesty McDonald’s burgers are much more value for money and definitely better taste. Steak - hardly chewable and this is in the place positioning themselves as steak house . Toilets - separate issue , the cherry on the top , no idea why they opted in for unisex toilets , but the picture of male guests peeing with open doors did not appeal to me at all and made me feel extremely uncomfortable to use the toilet . How such toilets can be suitable for children ?? We definitely will not be coming back."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,value;food,Food is pretty average here to be honest. Service okay. A bit overpriced for what you get...........in my opinion.
tripadvisor,eng,-1,service;food,"We ordered a starter that was forgotten about entirely, waitress didn’t even notice. Fairly slow service but not terrible. Burgers weren’t great, considering that it’s all this place does they don’t do them well. They don’t ask how you want them cooked and they all come over cooked and dry. They obviously use lean meat but it means that burgers are dry and a bit bland, they need to use a higher fat content and get some real flavour in there. The chips are the nicest I’ve had in a long time and my husband said the onion rings are the best he’s ever had! The choice of beers are never ending and they even do pairings with the burgers. They have this odd thing where you pay as you exit, which is odd but there was no one   there?! There were two staff manning the whole restaurant at dinner time.  "

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food;value,"Felt for a steak in Norwich on a weekend for work. They had a good reputation and seem to be an institution in Norwich. Place is well laid out and spacious. Staff are friendly and efficient. Pretty typical fare for a steakhouse but I did like the wide range of steak cuts and weights - I wanted as starter so I only ordered a 6oz steak for my main which was cooked well and I had no complaints. Apparently, they are always busy - I went just after the lunch rush but it picks up again in early afternoon! Prices were reasonable and I was happy with the choice."

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,"Second time visiting Middleton’s in Peterborough, and blown away a second time! The classic Middleton Grill and Sundae both lived up to their name, steaks being cooked to perfection, zingy ribs falling off the bone and delicious grilled chicken; even the ice cream had an incredible taste! While the food was fantastic, it’s important to mention the brilliant assistance provided by the waiting staff, especially the bearded gentleman named ‘Jack’; who couldn’t have been more helpful during the meal today. I know for certain that I will definitely be coming back to Middleton’s again."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"Middletons, a steakhouse built into an old Natwest Bank branch - The main room itself is a high vaulted ceiling with central dome with a windowed oculus. Large, highly place stained glass windows make for a amazingly airy room and in daylight it is bright. The seating is well arranged with plenty of space between tables to move and several banks of plush booth seats. We, a party of three (two adults and a young child) arrived and chose from the £7.95 two course set menu meal. Complentary water was immediately served and upon onced ordered starters arrived promptly - followed by main course which arrived shortly after. Although the portions were small the food was of good and tasty. Looking through the main menu, it was quite large and detailed but dishes averaged somewhere around £12-15 per person - not unreasonable considering the quality of what we recieved on a set menu. Our grumble with this restuarant was the poor service we recieved from the waiting staff. Although attentive to our daughters experience, they ignored both of us adults. I asked for drink at the start of the meal and didn't recieve it until I had asked for it twice and was then given the wrong drink (given how long I had waited for it in the first place, I didn't want to risk being forgotten again) - this was then followed by us not being offered dessert by anybody, which at the time we wanted, but once again decided not to bother for risk of being forgotten again. Then, we tried to get the bill, I think we waited about 10 minutes for a waiter to notice we were waiting for the bill and then the card machine. I can understand delays in service when somewhere is busy or has few staff, but we were one of four or five tables in the restaurant at the time and there were many members of staff. Verdict - Good food, if small, disappointing service!"
tripadvisor,eng,-1,value;service,We walked in here for lunch on a busy Saturday. Once we were inside the staff acknowledged us and put us on a table downstairs. The service was decent but the food is very overpriced for small portions. The food is average but the prices are outrageous. I will not be returning to Spaghetti house anytime soon.

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;value;service,"Meet up with friends and had the set menu, up till 5pm on a sat.  Starters ok, mains sufficient for the price and desserts a bit on the small side but for £9.95 was sufficient. Service was great, water refilled straight away. Overall pleasant visit."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food,We were told about this place. They certainly know how to cook a fillet steak to perfection - our 2 meals and one coke drink was about £54 but well worth it. Can't wait to go again when in Norwich.
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"Service.. although friendly enough, was very slow and sporadic. There was a group of us and we had to go out of our way to get drinks.

tripadvisor,eng,1,food;environment,"The food was delicious... When it finally came out. A group of 8 of us booked for a Saturday night. It was a good start when we were shown to our table immediately, and our waiter came swiftly to the table to get our drink choices. They arrived promptly, and then our food order was taken. (All of us only ordered main courses) The wait that followed really tainted the experience for me. It took around an hour and 15 minutes for our food to arrive.By the time it came out, we were all so hungry our table practically fell into silence while we dug in.One of the group ordered dessert, and luckily that came out in a more reasonable time frame!The rest of the experience was enjoyable though. The atmosphere was good, cocktails and food was lovely. Our waiter too was friendly.The main toilets were a bit hard to find, and there were quite a lot of stairs to reach them. But there was an accessible toilet. The cleanliness was good too.The wait time may alter depending on the day and party size but I certainly would not go back on a Saturday night in a large group!"

Staff were friendly. I had not been to a Middletons before. Table for 2 was a bit small and rather close to fire extinguishers on the wall, but ok. Drinks came quickly. We ordered sirloin steaks and they were cooked just as we like them, tender and nice flavour. We did not have room for dessert but shared a cheese plate which was a reasonable size and price. We have seen cheese plates in other restaurants that are small and  ridiculously expensive. A rather noisy restaurant but an enjoyable meal. Well worth a visit."

The food was really good and the waiting staff were very polite and friendly. Everything was also very reasonably priced. I did feel a tad like the staff were keen to get us in and out of the door asap though, which was not a problem, as we were on a timer ourselves, but worth noting if you're looking for a place to loiter for a few hours."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"We had booked in for a Sunday lunch and first impressions were good. It's a beautifulold building very nicely converted to the Middletons. We were quickly showed to our table, the drinks served also quite quickly but sadly it all went downhill from here,We were offered the roast meat lunch and chose either  beef or beef and lamb. One of our party opted for the battered fish.We expected fine slices of the roasts but what was served up looked more like a meat stew, impossible to tell quite what it was. It turned out to be fatty meat, difficult to cut and even worse to eat and you just could not tell which was beef and which was lamb.50% + was inedible and left. The fish course was so undercooked the batter was soggy inside and the fish just not cooked.All in a disappointing experience. We thought Middleton's would be a meal to remember, shame, for us  it's better forgotten."

We only got starters but 1- the food was genuinely delicious! 2- honestly haven't had such polite AND relaxed service in a long time. No rush, no pressure (GREAT SALES) as they gently asked and pushed mains options. I work in sales, and spend a lot of time in restaurants, and used to work in a lot to, sometimes it is most simple of experiences, like smiling waiters with a genuine desire to serve (e.g. tailored suggestion on food based on a conversation about what I like) that you remember - that will keep you coming back. Mark - Quality service mate and I thank you for it. Easy and relaxed but keeping good communication around our orders and timings. Jack - if you hadn't have asked me to review I wouldnt have even known to come on trip advisor, and if it hadn't have been pushed in such a subtle and beautiful way, I wouldnt have bothered. Looking forward to coming back. Thank you guys."

Ziemlich einfache Angelegenheit, dann man wählt den gewünschten ""Ball"" (in unserem Fall Schwein, Hühnchen, Lamm oder die vegetarische Variante), dann die Beilage (in unserem Fall Kartoffelbrei mit Gemüse oder ein Salat) und anschließend noch das Getränke. Dann entscheidet man sich, ob man im stylischen Innenraum oder lieber auf der Straße Platz nehmen möchte und wartet auf sein Essen.Die Fleischbällchen waren gefüllt (Schwein mit Kichererbsen und Soße, Hünhchen mit Pilzen und Rahm), der Kartoffelbrei war der Hammer und die Soßen haben klasse gepasst. Allerdings war auch der Salat sehr lecker.Das Bier war spitze und die Mädels lobten die hausgemachte Limo in höchsten Tönen.Ein wirklich grandioses Konzept, extrem schmackhaft und sehr gemütlich!!!"
tripadvisor,eng,1,food;service,When going back to Ghent we were back at this place cause we had great experience last time we were here. You really wouldnt know at all that is all vegan!We went both times with smiles on our faces. 
tripadvisor,nld,0,service;food,Zeer vriendelijke bediening en wij hadden een salade cesar super lekker wij moesten wel lang wachten op ons eten maar het was ook ontzettend druk de moeite waard om terug te gaan eten en eens kip te proberen 
tripadvisor,nld,1,environment;service;food,"Het restaurant ziet er geld uit. De burgers zijn vers en erg lekker. De kaart is alleen niet erg uitgebreid. En de bediening is ook niet erg vriendelijk, maar voor de rest is het een prima adresje voor een burger. "
tripadvisor,nld,-1,value;service;food,"Lange wachttijden, wijnglas waar nog geen 10cl in zat en koude binnenkant van lamsburger zorgden voor minder aangenaam gevoel terwijl de smaak echt ok was, koolsla zeer lekker. Maar in verhouding met de prijs en de minpuntjes zal het nog even duren eer we terug komen. "

tripadvisor,eng,1,food;innovation;reputation,Burgers here were different to what we are used to in the UK but turned out to be outstanding and unique. Also the fact that for each burger they give you a suggestion of what beer best goes with it is pretty cool too. Highly recommend. Chips were good too.

Un burger très moyen pour ensuite subir au mieux douleurs d'estomac et au pire diarrhée durant 2 jours !!Je recommande vivement au service d'hygiène compétent d'y faire rapidement une descente avant qu'ils ne continu à intoxiquer des touristes !!

All the staff very friendly and helpful. Especially Jack our waiter. Didn't feel rushed at all which made it nice and relaxed. Would defo visit again!
tripadvisor,eng,1,food,"The ""new meat lover"" burger is really good. I have had burgers in many places, but this is probably the second best burger I've had so far. While it is also on the more expensive side (15 euros), I wouldn't take that into account - good, honest and ""traditional"" burgers cost 12-13 everywhere. Paying 2-3 more euros and truly enjoying the burger is my choice. "
tripadvisor,eng,-1,service,"Sat outside in the tables at the centre of the street for 15min. Waitress kept on coming out to attend the few tables just out. Didn’t even look at us. When I went inside to enquire if there was service table a rude guy just said simply “no”. What if I order at the bar and carry the food and drinks myself? Same answer, exactly same word “no”."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,consistency;value;environment,"I like Veal Limone- but this was not the best and it is a pity as I really wanted to enjoy it. The service was good alas the food let them down. I ate it all as I was hungry and really hate sending food back but I am not blaming the chef but the meat buyer. Veal is a soft meat and whilst this was not ""hard"" it was tough. Also and this is where I do blame the Chef the potatoes were were a little bit al dente. For the price it was not worth it but I guess I will return because I like the chain. Also if you are disabled it is quite a trek to the loo!"
tripadvisor,eng,1,food;value;experience;reputation,"We have had dinner at this Restaurant several times. The meals were well presented, portion size was either small or regular. The pasta was cooked al dente and decadently creamy. The waitress will ask if you want Parmesan cheese which is grated from the block directly onto your meal. Desert were equally as scrumptious. Moderately priced. Highly Recommended."

However, it is always a great atmosphere and I will always return because of good memories."
tripadvisor,spa,-1,service,La señorita que atiende se la pasa regalando a los clientes. Mala cara y cinismo cuando uno le dice que ni siquiera le entiende lo que le reclama al cliente. Jamás volvería a un lugar donde como cliente me quieren tratar como su empleado. Ojalá y a esta persona la despidan pronto o se quedarán sin clientes. Una lástima ya que el producto no es malo y con un servicio denigrante para ser un local “premium”.

Everything tasted Very fresh and the pasta and Calzone served very hot which makes a lovely change.Plenty of topping on bruschetta and fillings and toppings in both the Calzone and Carbonara.  Loved the fact you could order a small or regular portion of Carbonara for your main course too.Prices very good including 2 large diet dokes and service charge the total was £47.Would definitely come here again when going to theatre land."

Fair prices - definitely a good place to visit. "
tripadvisor,fra,1,environment;service;food,"L’ambiance est vraiment chouette, le personnel est agréable. Les entrées sont vraiment bonnes. Cependant, la viande des hamburgers n’est pas top du tout. Beaucoup trop grasse, sûrement industriel. La sauce barbecue est beaucoup trop sucrée et enlève tout le goût. Note positive, la salade qui accompagne l’hamburger est vraiment rafraîchissante et agréable à manger. "

tripadvisor,spa,-1,service;food,"En primer lugar tardaron una hora en servirnos. Una vez que nos sirvieron, los platos que debían estar flameados no lo estaban. Se lo dijimos al camarero hasta en dos ocasiones y nos aseguró que sí que estaba flameado con bastantes malas formas. Nos lo tuvimos que creer y comérnoslo. Después de comer, una de las personas que estábamos comiendo, empezó a notar sensación de haber bebido, esta persona está embarazada. Al decírselo al camarero por tercera vez y decirle que estaba embarazada, le cambió la cara y, por fin, se acercó a preguntar a la zona de la cocina, después de un rato en la cocina salió para intentar engañarnos y decirnos que lo habían flameado dentro. Sabemos que es mentira porque la cocina está abierta y se ve perfectamente cómo preparaban los platos. Desde nuestra mesa incluso les vimos echar el líquido de flamear. Al ir a pagar, el camarero volvió a sacar el tema y, de muy malas formas siguió con la misma mentira. Nos dijo que éramos muy cabezotas e incluso llegó a empujar a la mujer embaraza.Una experiencia muy desagradable que nunca pensé vivir en un restaurante."

Les pâtes carbonara étaient divines: je n'en ai jamais mangé d'aussi bonnes, avec un très bon goût. Seul bémol: la pâte à pizza un peu dure. Le gâteau au chocolat du dessert était également délicieux avec la glace à la vanille bien copieuse.Je recommande sans hésiter ce restaurant!"
tripadvisor,nld,1,service;food,"Recent geluncht in Poule & Poulette. Grappig ingericht, met zitplaatsen een halve verdieping hoger (ik weet niet of de bediening daar blij mee is). Hoge banken, waardoor het erg intiem is. De kaart is leuk: uiteraard kip, maar iedere keuken staat er op (van kipburger tot vol au vent tot tikka massala).De kip is ook echt prima, mooi smakelijk vlees, duidelijk beter dan gemiddeld. Toch zijn er wel wat verbeterpunten. Dat zit hem met name in de snelheid: het duurt echt lang voordat we uitgeserveerd krijgen en dan krijgen we ook nog eens in tweeën uitgeserveerd. Ook zijn de porties vrij krap bemeten.Sympathieke  zaak met een leuk concept, kwalitatief goed vlees, maar een tikkeltje understaffed."

We have waited 30min for the startes and it was cold, and the burgers burnt, the dessert of one my friend had something inedible and the waiter said that was dry fruit, and dry fruits wasn't even in the incredients of his dessert, at the end we were charged 3pounds extras because the burgers was too big. Not recommended at all"
tripadvisor,eng,1,service;food,Accidentially found this place. Our visit started with an impolite waitress and not providing any baby chairs. Therefore we didn‘t expect any happy end. But another waitress from the next shift was awesome and the burgers and fries were also very good. Would visit it again - but first check out who‘s on service ;-)

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"We have visited Middletons for the set lunchtime menu on several occasions and always found it excellent. Today however we expected the same  experience only to get a really really awful burger from the set menu. It did not taste anything like the burgers we have had here on previous visits. It tasted burnt and was dry & was more gristle than meat, we wondered if they had changed supplier, we will not be returning . It was the worst burger we have ever had & how hard can it be to cook a burger? ."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,innovation;reputation,"My husband and I came to this restaurant when we first met and had a fab meal and over the years we have returned but this was for our 20th anniversary. I had garlic bread- very oily, my husband had calamari- a frozen offering. He had a diavola pizza which was OK and I had pollo alla milanese which said it came with crispy pangrattato steak chips, rocket & tomato salad which actually translated as about 10 emaciated chips and 2 cut cherry tomatoes and 5 pieces of rocket. Certainly not worth £14.95 and they added a service charge. This restaurant is not worth visiting anymore which makes me very sad."

The staff were not in any way attentive, despite it being 3pm so well past the usual lunch rush. Our food took 55 minutes to arrive, despite us asking twice (we had a flight to catch) and my chicken was stone cold. The coleslaw was not coleslaw but some sort of undressed, limp Asian salad.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,service,"Me and my friends had an extremely unpleasant visit to this restaurant. The staff is very unfriendly and not kind. We ordered 2 drinks and one burger, and requested tap water (which is commonly done in several Dutch restaurants). The waiter not only refused to give us tap water but also, when we asked about the reason behind this, she was rude to us and treated us badly. If the restaurant refuses to give clients tap water, the least they can do is offer an explanation in a respectful way. We felt disrespected as people and as clients. Overall, it is just not a nice environment and, to be honest, the food was underwhelming. There are much better burgers with much friendlier staff. "
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service,"Firstly I would like to say we had a fantastic evening at Middletons Steakhouse yesterday (24th April). The food was excellent with a comprehensive menu but the highlight of the evening was our lovely waitress, Evie. She made us feel very welcome with a friendly but not over familiar manner. After a slight kitchen ‘faux pas’ Evie covered it well with a smile and she has a great sense of humour. She was attentive but not intrusive. I will certainly recommend this restaurant."

Vegan and vegetarian burgers did not disappoint - portions were fair and well balanced, ingredients tasted really fresh with crispy, flavorsome veggies and the side dishes - corn on the cob & french fries with truffled mayo - were really yummy as well! Of course it's not haute cuisine but hey, really nice as for a burger place (also huge plus for multiple vegetarian options!).Our waitress - I unfortunately didn't ask for her name! - short-haired girl with marvelous smile, was very kind and engaged in providing us with service. She explained the way everything works at Ellis and was very polite, at the same time giving us the space and time we needed. Over all really good experience, wouldn't hesitate to go back next time we feel like veggie burgers!"
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;environment;food,"We went for a birthday meal, it was disappointing. The good point was that the staff were lovely. There was no ambiance. We were sat on a table the other side of an open partition to their order screen where staff would chat, but this had the effect of interrupting our conversations and we often thought someone was talking to us when they weren’t. Poor design on the restaurants part. The food was mediocre and disappointing. Starters were good, however on ordering steaks rare to blue, only one came that way. Mine was definitely medium to well done. The ribs were not as tender as expected and the sauce seemed undercooked which meant it was slightly tart. Shame, we haven’t been for a year and it’s definitely not as good as we remember. "

To Middleton’s credit the meal was removed from the bill but unfortunately we won’t be returning again. Seems more staff are required immediately to make a improvement.

It came with a half tomato and 1 mushroom! Not even a side salad. Tbh the dishes coming out looked quite sad. No colour on the plates whatsoever. It's not cheap in here, you pay extra for sides so the least they could do is put a decent side salad with it. On the plus side, the server was a nice friendly chap. On fact most of the staff seemed nice."

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,"We visited Middletons last night for the first time for a birthday meal and had a fantastic meal. The staff were all attentive and friendly and the service was spot on. We all opted for a steak main, which was cooked to perfection depending on people's individual requests and even though we were feeling pretty full, we couldn’t say no to the dessert menu. Turned out that we were glad we did opt for a dessert in the end as they were delicious too. The baileys and white chocolate cheesecake and sticky toffee pudding are highly recommended. Now that we’ve found this little gem of a restaurant, we will definitely be visiting more often. Thank you to the staff at Middletons for a wonderful birthday meal!"
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food;reputation,I enjoyed the food even though they did not have my first choice. The waitress service was excellent and although I did not drink my friend enjoyed her wine wine very muchS.Blanc Firmian. She ate the Tagliatelle Pollo E Aspargi. I had the Scaloppa Di Vitello which is actually very good.I would recommend this Spaghetti House and although very busy it was a slick operation.
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;value,"Took a couple of friends here for dinner last night.We were welcomed by a lovely young lady who managed to find a table for us earlier than booked as were were ravenous.After a long wait starters came, not bad.  A very long wait later the mains arrived.  Well,  what a disappointment!  Cold plates, cold grey looking steaks and very very small potions of lobster, in fact mine was all shell with two small mouth fulls of lobster!The mixed grill was also cold and grey!   To be fair, we complained and the complaint was dealt with in a very professional manner, we chose to eat the food as we were so hungry and could not face another long wait and the young lady, the manageress I assume did take money off the bill.The management need to look at the amount of customers the kitchen and wait staff are serving at any one time, because last night they could not cope !!  Will not be returning any time soon."

We didn't feel like we was being rushed at all and even though it was full we was not waiting long for food. I had forgot my ID so i couldn't drink however there is a range of cocktails and drinks on the menu, and bonus for me that day a range of soft drinks too. I had a sirloin steak and it was perfectly cooked, the best steak ive had in ages!! My other half had a mix grill which smelt amazing and looked even better!"

Restaurant is clean and tidy, what more could you ask? "
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"I used to be a regular customer of Middletons, but sadly it has majorly gone downhill. The downstairs seating with the metal partition has clearly been designed to cram as many people as possible into the restaurant, to the detriment of the customer (it's more spacious in McDonalds). I even go to the lengths of requesting NOT to sit there when booking a table, however my request was ignored when we last visited.My partner and I had the unfortunate mis-pleasure of being seated next to the partition/another couple on Saturday evening. It was like sitting on a table of four with two other people we did not know. I couldn't even hear my partner talking to me from across the table as all I could hear was the people squeezed next to us.We considered leaving the restaurant at this point as it was so intrusive, but we were there for a Birthday meal which we didn't want to be ruined so persevered. Unfortunately the last straw came when I was hit with mucus from the gentleman next to me blowing his nose (yes, the seats are THAT close!). We asked to be seated elsewhere in the restaurant and the staff obliged after a 10 minute wait.We thought the unpleasantness would then be over and we could enjoy the meal. Ordering was smooth, however we still did not have our food after a 45 minute wait. Other customers who has been seated and ordered after us were receiving food before us. Sadly when the food arrived my ""medium"" fillet steak was so burnt I had to scrape charcoal off the top of it and my mushroom and tomato was stone cold. My partner's chicken was also burnt to a crisp.By this point we'd had enough of being in the restaurant and just wanted to get out, so we left as soon as possible.Thanks for ruining our Birthday celebrations Middletons. We used to be loyal, regular customers of yours but we'll be taking our business to Prime from now on."

You had a lot of varieties to choose from, and all of them were happy with their choice. I had an Italian style burger with pine-nuts, sun-dried tomatoes and pesto. My wife had a wasabi-chicken burger and my mother-in-law a vegan burger with hazelnut for beef! The 4th was something spicy, I'm afraid I forgot details here.

A menu was provided and we chose our meal off what looked like a fabulous menu.  However no one came to take our order. After 15 minutes of waiting, we asked one of the waitresses who told us that she couldn’t take our order and that a colleague would do so. Still no one arrived to take our order, so we tried asking again - this time a different member of staff. His response was not what we had expected. He told us he was not going to take our order; that the kitchen could not cope; the bar could not cope and that “this was bad for us....” He was rude, unapologetic and simply waited for us to leave. There are many other places where the staff are delightful - so avoid this place until they have had lessons in manners!! "
tripadvisor,nld,-1,food;service,"Ik ben al meerdere keren gaan eten bij Ellis burger en was deze keer echt ontgoocheld. Ik vroeg om Unionrings te krijgen bij het hoofdgerecht naast mijn burger en coleslaw en kregen deze uiteindelijk tóch als voorgerecht, waarschijnlijk verstond de bediening mij niet aangezien hij enkel Frans en gebrekkig Engels sprak bleek achteraf. In mijn coleslaw bij het hoofdgerecht zat een groot stuk plastic, we hebben dit gemeld bij de bediening maar deze zei enkel 'Désolé madame'. Toen we dit daarna ook aan de kassa even ter spraken lieten komen, je kan maar hopen op een kleine korting of alvast welgemeende excuses, kwam er ook niet echt respons, enkel dat het doorgegeven zal worden naar de keuken.Buiten dit was mijn burger wel lekker! Dus zeer spijtig, hopelijk gebeurd dit niet nog eens."

We were a group of seven but were set in a small table in the corner right the front door like they put us on the box, even the restaurant was not full.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;environment,"My husband and I were off to an event for the evening, travelling from Norwich, so we decided to have an early dinner at Middletons. We were looking forward to it having eaten at the Norwich restaurant on a number of occasions. The restaurant was nearly empty. Two tables of two finished whilst we were ordering and a table of four arrived whilst we were waiting for our food. There was a large dirty table next to us which remained uncleared for the duration of our visit. My husband ordered the Middletons Burger, without the bun, which comes with salad instead along with fries. When it came it had sweet potato fries, which had to be exchanged. The salad was a lettuce wedge and a piece of tomato! I ordered the fillet steak with jacket potato, cooked rare. My steak had to go back as it was still breathing and the tiny jacket potato was still hard, it could not be mashed! Extremely poor. No excuses as the restaurant was empty. I heard a customer leaving say to the waiter I hope it gets busier so you’re not bored."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"I used to go to Chop Bloc in Chelmsford, which I liked. Yesterday I ordered the 8oz ribeye, rare, with just butter to accompany it. The steak was cooked as I asked and tender but it was with over trimmed or wasn’t a ribeye. I eat a lot of ribeye and this wasn’t one. As for the butter: it was margarine! How cynical is that. Middletons clearly doesn’t think that it’s customers know or care about food and doesn’t think twice about deceiving them. No good restaurant would have margarine anywhere in the building. The steak had been rubbed with some sort of oil and drenched in salt. OTOH my friend ate her burger and chips very happily. This would be zero marks but for our lovely waiter, Peter, who was everything you want a waiter to be: charming and genuinely interested in us having an enjoyable meal. He understood the problem, tried to put it right and took the cost of the steak off our bill. I won’t go there again but my friend enjoyed her meal and probably will. I hope Peter is her waiter next time, too."

Thuis zie ik dat er geen kaas op zit, waar ik dus wel voor betaald heb, en die burger was ook nog eens heel taai. Bij het ophalen kwam de kok met 2 Ellis burgers aan en met 2 frites, ik zei dat is niet voor mij. Want ik had ook maar 1 frites gevraagd. Na 5 minuten kwam hij weer boven met zogenaamd mijn bestelling. Thuis zie ik dat er wel 2 keer frites bij zit. Ik denk dat ik de foute bestelling heb gehad, die even terug op de gril is gegaan. Ik ga dus terug naar Ellis, en zeg, kijk even wat de keuken hiervan vindt. Komt ze terug, met de opmerking : Niets aan de hand, niks mis mee. Ik zei, hij is heel taai. Toen zei ze, maar het is dan ook niet handig om een burger zonder broodje te bestellen. Maar dit staat gewoon op de site dat het kan ! Toen kwam er sorry, maar dat vindt ik nog al weinig voor een burger van meer dan 12,= euro ! Verder werd er niets gedaan. Ik kom daar zeker 1 keer per week, jammer hoor.

I’ve tried to like this place but I just have to concede it’s not great. The decor is ok, the service is ok.....but the food is sub standard. Tonight I had the porterhouse steak, bearing in mind this is £33 then you add the sides I’m paying £50 for just my meal and it was a pretty bad meal!! The sides were at best adequate and the steak itself was terrible for a £33 porterhouse!! It was chewy, under seasoned and had rind all the way through. I think it’s the first time I’ve paid that amount for a meal and thought it was pretty s***!! My calamari starter was very small aswell and my wife’s surf and turf was basically like something you would get in a Wetherspoons! In fact you could get a meal of equal quality in a Wetherspoons for about 80% less so unfortunately I’ve tried Middletons 3 times now and I just have to admit it’s not a good restaurant. It was virtually empty on a Friday night and you can see why."

When it arrives, it looks wonderful. See pic below. However, the burger patty had a rubber, elastic taste and when it’s a little cold, tasted fatty. We did not try the veggie ones made with hazelnuts. Everyone agreed we should have just gone to Burger King. Service: lovely, friendly, young staff, but very slow service. "

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;environment,"Not been here for an evening meal before. Full restaurant, but service was good and staff friendly. I had pate, Mixed grill. The main issue is that 3 out of 4 desserts we wanted were not available. The restaurant did compensate with a free drink. The 2 women had many drinks and the staff didn't push them out until gone midnight. 4 people with many drinks and a bottle of presecco was GBP185 so GBP 46.25 p.p.Good atmosphere."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;value,"Had dinner here on Friday night and what a disappointment. I last visited in 2016 and now I know why I haven't rushed back since. My ribeye steak was tough and dry, I had it with prawns which had gone to mush and I didnt even get the mushroom and tomato that everyone else got. I also ordered a bernaise sauce which was cold, when queried I was told by the waiter that is how it is to be served which is the first time ever. For the price of the food in here it simply isn't worth it, made me realise just how nice somewhere like Miller & Carter is for the same price. There was also dirty plates with food piled high in the kitchen which you can see as you walk back from the toilet. Very unpleasant. Safe to say I will not be returning. "
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"Been to Middleton’s in Kings Lynn a number of times and the food was always good until tonight. Just had the worst meal ever. I ordered my sirloin medium/rare but arrived very well done. I had to send it back, the next one I got was cooked medium/well. The quality of the meat was extremely poor. My husband ordered his rump medium and that too was given very well done and completely dried out, as if it was reheated. He didn’t bother to return it as he was starving, waited 40 minutes or so for our mains. We were extremely disappointed as we hoped a steakhouse would be able to cook steaks"

I had the Crazy Red Veggie Burger which was made with Paprika, spinach, pecans, lemon mayo and a few others I can't remember.  It was very good and the bun toasted.  Came with tomatoes and some wonderful Belgian Fries.  They were fast and friendly. They also make a veggie burger that is supposed to taste like real hamburger but I did not want to try it because I don't like beef.  They did have lots of alternatives.  Great food"
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food,We came for a meal with friends. There was 11 of us and the food was really quick and everyone enjoyed there food. If I could give feedback to why I haven't given you 5 stars it is this. I had seabass with a side of new potatoes. I think it look plain. 2 pieces of fish with a dish of new potatoes just wasn't visually satisfying and it lacked flavour. Serving the seabass on a bed of veg or adding some leaves to the top wouldn't cause extra expense. If the steaks come with mushroom and tomato why can't the fish could with roasted peppers? Very strange!

tripadvisor,eng,-1,food,"Visited on a Saturday afternoon, pre-booked a large party. Was told when booking that the food wait would be 45 minutes. The place was heaving so I did think it may be longer. Our last guest arrived and we finally got to order the food. Two people chose starters from the smaller menu, 1, 2 or 3 courses for set price. We were offered tap water in bottles so most of us stuck with that. We waited and waited and eventually asked when our food would arrive, we were told it was the lamb holding everything up. Food finally arrived and the 2 starters arrived with the mains. I personally wouldn’t have liked that but the 2 people in question just ate the 2 together! I had the bacon burger and chips. The burger itself was good but the bacon was just too fatty, not sure who could eat bacon like that!All in all an ok experience but probably not one I would repeat anytime soon."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"Visited on a Bank Holiday Monday, and although I have been here many, many times and it has always been fantastic, this time it was anything but. We had the mussels to start with, and they were pretty tasteless, we weren't even given a bowl for the shells, so had to use the bread plate.The main was just OK, but absolutely nothing special.... very bland again, along with the starters. So we didn't bother with a dessert, but I did order an espresso martini. It was possibly the worse one I have ever had, to the point, that I did complain and asked for it to be removed from the bill as I couldn't drink it.Shame really, I used to really like this restaurant, but something has changed and not for the better.The only positive about the visit was the waiter, very good! Will I go back? Maybe but not in hurry, there's better steak restaurants in Colchester."

Service was friendly and attentive, but let down by average food. Starter was not that hot and the bread turning stale.

This year i went 3 evenings in a row. First evening ordered calamari starter and burger and coleslaw . Calamari arrived after i had eaten burger and was bland. Service slow.  No apology.  Burger was good. Second night service good, burger good. 2 colleagues arrived for carry outs which i added to my bill but only 1 got  their order after about 20 mins and the other had to wait another 15 minutes.Tonight i waited 10 minutes before being spoken to. Ordered a chicken burger coleslaw and onion rings. Over cooked onion rings arrived after i had eaten a very disappointing chicken burger. I got free nachos due to the wait for my burger.  There is a bit of work required to get this place back to where it was. I will not be back. "

Meat was cooked as asked (rare and m/rare) which is always a bit hit and miss in some places and was good value for money. It's not fine dining but then that's not the impression the place seeks to give. Good honest steakhouse at reasonable prices.

I ate the burger with 2 side dishes (fries and salad) with a drink for 18€ and the meal worth it!

The sauce lacked seasoning and was basically bulked up with such a ridiculous amount of mushrooms, it just wasn’t funny.Charging £8 for a bottle of. beer, also wasn’t funny.When the waitress came over to see if all was ok, I told her that yes, although the pizza was fine, it was overpriced as you just don’t get much of it. She told me that it’s half a pizza and the regular size costs £10......which begs the question, if it’s half, why are you charging me £8 instead of £5 I explained that I wasn’t complaining, it was merely my point of few. The manger then came over (whilst I was still trying to eat) and enquired about the ‘complaint’ so, I had to explain again, that in my opinion you’re charging quite a lot for very little.What’s the point?I should’ve just gone to Pizza Express"

The sauce was finished with the bread. The mixed grill arrived & was good in parts. The steak was OK but well done not medium. The chicken was good & the ribs were tasty. One complaint was it was at best luke warm, it certainly cold have been hotter & everyone in our group sad the same. I wasn't paying so not sure what the bill was."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,Visited with friends on a Sunday lunchtime. We all had cocktails to start which were scrumptious and all had a Sunday roast. Can't fault the food or drink and the staff were very pleasant and attentive. My 1st visit but not my last. Keep up the good work guys !!
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;value;environment,"Interesting idea. Very easy to build up your own plate. You simply pick up the type & gravy. All meatballs are handmade and you can see the process if you're curious. Word of advice - the portions are quite big so for us there were no room for desert. Great idea, simple and something different."
tripadvisor,fra,1,food,"Les bières, les burgers et les salades sont excellents. Même si le steak haché est cuit à « la belge », oui les français nous aimons la viande saignante 😉, le goût du burger est très bon. Nous reviendrons avec plaisir. "

Everything you can ask for. The free water and fruit on the communal tables was lovely to see. Definitely worth a visit."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"I want to believe that I caught the restaurant on a ""bad"" day. Ordered the Sirloin steak with no sauce and when asked how the steak should be prepared, I replied that I would leave it to the Chef. The steak duly arrived and while it was tasty and medium rare, I experienced it as being a little cooler than expected. However, it was tasty. I asked for a wine recommendation and the Malbec was suggested which I accepted. that was good. Ambience in the resto was ok apart from a table in some corner who enjoyed shouting out profanities every now and again. Would I come here again for a steak? Probably not."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience,"5 of us ate here on a Monday evening including some guests from Japan. We only ate main courses.The 12oz ribeye was a fantastic piece of meat and cooked really well and well seasoned. The sweet potato fries and onion rings excellent. The mushroom was as bad as the meat was good - cold, rubbery, flavourless.Service was fine and friendly and the restaurant was quiet as you would expect for a Monday evening. There was a small group of folks who came in and sat down behind the bar, who seemed to know some of the staff. One of them was either drunk or ill brought up as he kept shouting out and making noise although I did see one of the staff ask him to be quiet. Nevertheless I wouldn’t take business guests there again if that kind of thing is tolerated."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,"We came here for date night. Good menu, food delicious and cooked exactly as asked. Service was impeccable, we were served by Elise who couldn't have been any better. Tad on the hight side of reasonable pricing, but honestly worth it."
tripadvisor,eng,1,food;service,"At Ellis they serve a good variety of burgers  to choose from. The quality of the meat is very good and prepared well to make the most out of this meat. Bun is ok, but in the end nothing exciting happens. It is a good burger, but that’s it. Service was fast and adequate. "

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;environment;service;food,"Arrived and shown to our table but no offer to order drinks, had to ask a passing server to order a drink, which was then forgotten so had to ask another server. That seemed be the theme for the evening service wise, very slow and not very attentive. Once we ordered, starters came quite quickly. I had bbq ribs, and they were very nice and sticky - thankfully the excellent hand wipes were in ample supply. We then had to wait ages for our mains and no one came to ask us if we wanted more drinks, even though all our glasses were empty. When mains finally arrived the food was generally very nice. Only issue with my mixed grill was the steak was well undercooked. Asked for medium and it was quite rare. Didn't have time for dessert due to my taxi being booked for 9:30 (thinking 2.5 hours would be ample for dinner). So food generally very good but service not so good. "

The quality of the meal was surprisingly better than any similar place home in the states."

This was not as good as we expected as the food was nothing special at all, could of got better in our local chippy. She had a surf and turf with lobster, well the lobster was no bigger than a prawn and I had a sirloin steak and chips. Both our steaks were as chewy as you can imagine and the price for all this was not at all worth the money! There was also no toilet and can you believe it, they were only telling customers to use the toilet in another restaurant a few doors away because theirs were up the creek! Nope won't be going back here again! Over priced and over rated. Rubbish!!!!!!!!!!!!"

tripadvisor,nld,-1,service;environment;food,"Voor de eerste maal een Poule & Poulette bezocht.Eerste indruk : een toffe zaak, toffe sfeer en een leuke menukaart met aanvaardbare prijzen.Alhoewel de zaak tijdens ons bezoek maar ca. 20 bezoekers heeft zijn de wachttijden vrij lang : zowel voor het opnemen van de bestelling, het opdienen van de drankjes als het opdienen van het eten.De kip wordt mooi geserveerd.Zowel bij mij als de andere gasten aan onze tafel was de kip onvoldoende gaar. Een verschil van een paar minuten wellicht, maar het maakt dat kippepoot en kippevleugel merkelijk taai zijn. Het vlees valt zeker niet van het been. Jammer.Geen potje om de afval van de kip in te leggen en vooral geen vochtig doekje om je handen te reinigen na de maaltijd : bijzonder jammer.Twintig minuten na het beëindigen van onze maaltijd, op deze kalme avond, worden de borden afgeruimd : dan heb je geen zin meer in koffie of dessert. Nogmaals jammer.Alles is volgens ons te verklaren in de sfeer van nonchalance die in de zaak zit, wat leuk kan zijn voor de gast, maar niet mag overslaan op het personeel. Ze zijn vriendelijk maar daar stopt het ook. Jammer"

tripadvisor,eng,-1,service,Visited this place just this week. It was very obviously understaffed and unfortunately the few staff that were present looked miserable!! We waited for a long time to give our order - we weren’t even given a menu when we were seated so asked to borrow the one from the people at the table beside us. We only ordered a few starters and side dishes which took an age to arrive and half our order was missing. I asked for an ice tea which never arrived. Understaffed and miserable staff resulted in a pretty awful experience. The food was average at best...when it was finally served.

I guess we didn't realize what we were ordering with the Greek gyro boxes - all the ingredients (salad, meat, pita squares, sauces, fries) were sort of thrown into the box so, while it was tasty, it was somewhat challenging to eat.

Aan de cappuccino maar, mijn eerste slok was teleurstellend. Melk mooi opgeschuimd maar lauw:( dus snel drinken anders wordt de koffie koud. Na 15 min vroeg ik aan mijn tafelgenoot hebben we nu al eten besteld? Nee nog niet...ze komen vast zo. Na 10 min wachten nog geen serveerster gespot. Uiteindelijk afgerekend bij de kassa beneden. Tactisch gevraagd of er boven eten wordt geserveerd. Dit was wel het geval. Tips: zorg dat de melk goed warm is, laat de serveerster gelijk vragen of de klant wilt eten. "

tripadvisor,eng,0,reputation,"I was traveling to London and had been looking at possible places for dinner after theater and honestly although I don't usually order spaghetti when I am out for Italian, spaghetti just sounded really good. I got to the restaurant 30 minutes before closing. They were less than glad to see me. I already knew what I wanted and was able to order quickly. A couple tried to come in about 10 minutes after me and they were told they were closed. I was sitting up front and could hear them. I was rather surprised that they closed so early being right next to the theater district on a Friday night in general. The food was average/ok. I didn't eat any other Italian food while I was in London, so unsure of the standard. The server was also a little neutral toward me when I got there. As I ordered quickly and I think he realized I wasn't going to linger, he warmed up a lot and was very nice. The service was fast and good. The restaurant has many other good reviews so maybe I would try it again on another circumstance."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"Came for a meal with ex colleagues following redundancy. As we were a large group we had to pre order on line(and that wasn't straight forward!) We therefore expected that our meal would come out to us smoothly however it was almost an hour before my meal arrived. I have eaten at Middleton's so was looking forward to my meal, but I literally got a slice of salmon and a very small portion of wedges, no garnish, or anything. A very empty looking plate. Then I had ordered lemon posit, a plate was ""plonked"" in front of me with a small circle of cheesecake on a large plate, no sauce or decoration whatsoever. I couldn't believe my eyes especially as this wasn't what I expected and definitely not worth  the £5.25 I was charged for it. All the people I was sitting with were underwhelmed with their meals with one complaining to the staff saying how bad the meal and service had been and we would certainly not be paying the service charge! We could have made more of it but as we were there with someone who had been made redundant we didn't want to upset her even more.Middleton's what has happened, have been for meals with you several times and really enjoyed it, but have to say I wont be returning in the near future 🙁"

(There are 6 restaurants in a row in this street, so...) Twenty ministers later a server arrived with the open bottle and set it down with two glasses.  If you’re going to serve wine, you need to be able to, you know, serve wine!  Burgers were ok,cooked to a lovely medium pink but not at all flavourful.  The Ellis classic was bland; the meatlover good.  The sweet potato fries were also tasteless - maybe this is a new world vegetable?  And both sauces were inappropriate.  Chipotle mayo is the norm in Canada and I’d recommend it here too!Overall, this was very overpriced, underwhelming, and substandard service.  Try elsewhere.  "

tripadvisor,nld,-1,service;food,"Vandaag 24/5 voor het eerst naar Ellis geweest en doe dit nooit meer.Meteen na het plaatsnemen werd de drank opgenomen (die ook redelijk snel gebracht werd) maar toen begon de ellende. zeker 10 minuten moeten wachten tot er iemand  de bestelling voor het eten kwam opnemen. We bestelden een Ellis burger 2.0 en een classic burger met frietjes en coleslaw (geen super grote bestelling, maar toch). na 40 minuten wachten nog steeds niets, maar eens nagevraagd en het antwoord was dat het eten er zo aan komt. Dan nog maar iets te drinken besteld. Na nog eens 15 minuten wachten kwam uiteindelijk (na bijna een uur) het eten maar van de 2e rond drank geen spoor. Nog maar eens na gevraagd en eindelijk, toen we de helft van het eten al op hadden kwam uiteindelijk de drank. Dat was wel nodig want het was lang geleden dat ik zo'n droge hamburger gegeten heb, moest die naar binnen spoelen. De geheime speciale Ellis saus van de Ellis 2.0 burger is waarschijnlijk erg duur want er zit heel weinig van die saus op je hamburger (een zeer dun laagje op de onderste heft van je broodje) alhoewel je meer dan 10€ voor zo'n burger betaalt.Samengevat: slechte service, zeer trage bediening, eten niets speciaals, duur."

Toen we dit melde bij het afrekenen kregen we een absurt antwoord van een mannelijke medewerker; ‘oh dan moet ik even flink spanken vanavond, gelukkig vind ik dat niet zo erg’ en hij draaide zich om en liep weg.

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food,"Had lunch here recently with my husband and wondered why I hadn't written a review before as we have eaten here quite a few times.  We love this place - not only is the meat sourced and prepared by their own butchery in Norwich, but everything here is hand made and hand-prepared. Burgers are made from scratch, and are delicious, and they offer amazing spare ribs and all sorts of grills as well as fish!  The meat is fabulous- best place in my opinion for amazing quality steaks (but a more reasonable price than the larger chains around!).  I had halloumi and veg kebabs to start with (delicious!), my husband had the sticky bbq spare ribs.  For mains, I had a fabulous fillet steak which was perfectly cooked (with a lovely dressed salad) as was my husband's rib eye (with new potatoes and crushed peas). Sides come as standard with any dish too. I took a photo before the sauces arrived - Diane for me and mushroom for my husband all freshly made and the flavours are terrific! Lots of choice for desserts too, but we hardly ever have room for them.  Good quality wines - we had the house Portuguese rosè which is very nice.  The staff here are just lovely- nothing is too much trouble and are always on hand and very friendly.  Try the lunch set menu - unbelieveable food and £10 for 3 courses!!! This place is a hidden gem in Watford! "

Si vous n'êtes pas a quelque euros prêt, c'est un bon restaurant de burger. ( pensés à préciser la cuisson de votre viande si il ny a pas trop de monde en salle)"

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"My wife and I had ribeye steaks, asked for medium rare and they came out rare. Evening ruined. Offered a 25% discount on the food. The fact we didn't eat it, and they were 19.95 each, that's extremely poor. I questioned whether they considered this a fare discount, but TBH we wont be going back, and neither will any of my family. In comparison, when we had a problem with our food at TGIF , the manager came out, apologised profusely, and refunded our meals. That's customer service for you, and as a result we will go back there. Not Middleton's though."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,"First off I must praise the quality of the filet steak - delicious. The wine (Argentinian Marlbec) was expensive for what it was. The place was very busy but the service was attentive and very polite,although slow to get the food out (Saturday 8pm). The cheese board had the saddest celery batons ever. There's no need to pre cut a celery stick it takes seconds. Just under£100 for the two of us."

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food,Pretty good experience. Steaks were cooked exactly how we asked. One of our group is a bit of a big girls blouse and wanted well done. The rest of us are a bit more male so had ours how god intended. All the steaks were good quality cuts and service was excellent.
tripadvisor,nld,-1,service;value;food,"Zijn gaan zitten op een zondag namiddag. Waarbij we voor de vegan beetroot balletjes en de nachos gingen (voor hem en haar). Behalve dat het fingerfood en het drinken een aardige tijd op zich liet wachten vielen de nachos zwaar tegen. Niet warm met koude kaas eroverheen. De Beetroot balls zijn geweldig van smaak eveneens als de saus, wel maar 6 balletjes, waardoor prijs kwantiteit niet evenredig is.  Maar voor een prijs van dik €7 voor beide gerechten per stuk viel dit zwaar tegen en voelde dit als een deceptie. "
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"Had three 18oz Chateaubriand steak for our table obviously had to wait but that was fine but asked for the steak to be medium and red in the middle for all three of the steaks but they all turned up over cooked, cooked all the way though which was very disappointing as it just tasted bad and dry. This has not just happened once we came again to see if they will cook it right for once but again over cooked. Chips were over cooked and hard Don’t think much of middletons anymore"

The waitresses were very helpful and friendly, and overall it's a very nice restaurant and I will definitely go again."
tripadvisor,nld,1,food;service,"Goede kennismaking pet P&P.  Vriendelijke bediening, efficiënte bediening, lekkere kip  sla (iets te veel dressing) en kroketten.  Dit waren er echter amper 5.  Lekker, dat wel. Maar 5 ... dan maar bijbestellen.  En dan moet je blijkbaar hele portie bijbetalen.  Tip aan P&P: geef er 7 of laat bijbestelde kroketten goedkoper zijn.  Echte tip: geef ze gratis.  Als klant verwacht ik dat eigenlijk wel.  Maar een compromis '7' lijkt me redelijk.  Personeel stond open voor deze 'klacht', dàt is op zich leuk.  Hopelijk neemt iemand ze wel ergens au sérieux (want was duidelijk niet eerste opmerking hierover & de reactie die personeel krijgt 'als gratis zullen sommigen 4 porties vragen' is m.i. niet enkel fout, het inzicht is commercieel ook verkeerd ... ).   Maar - sry voor de lange exposé - algemeen: aan te bevelen als de kroket- (e.a. bijgerechten) issue opgelost wordt!!!"

Despite being 45 minutes early for our booking we were shown immediately to a table and received fantastic smiley, speedy and friendly service from Summer throughout our meal. Food was high quality - between us having two burgers and two steaks, all of which were generously-portioned, reasonably-priced and well cooked. The smells coming from the open kitchen were delicious and all the food passing by looked great - it would be dangerous to us if we lived nearby! Kitchen and service was a well-oiled machine, ambience was lovely, kids made to feel welcome. Will definitely visit again next time we find ourselves in MK."

We were served by laurentiu who couldn't have been more attentive. Anything we needed wasn't too much trouble. We had the calamari and garlic mushrooms to start which were both easy to share especially with the extra bread courtesy of laurentiu. Mains arrived shortly after both cooked fantastic,always reccomend the piri chicken and ribs. Two tasty desserts, creme brulee being my partners favourite so she was happy! Thankyou laurentiu and middletons for a great meal as always!"
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"Was an odd experience. Firstly service was slow and sporadic. Secondly we were sat behind the till/service area, I.e. the place where staff come to complain about customers and other staff. The music is so loud next to this area that they have to speak up. But we could hear every word! Not massively professional. The food on the other hand was lovely. Would we return, not sure. For me service is everything."
tripadvisor,nld,-1,service,"Mooie gezellige zaak en uitgebreid aanbod met overheerlijke burgers. Er is ook een mooi terras waar je – als het weer het toelaat – gezellig kan genieten.Zoals de naam “Beer & Burgers” het al zegt zijn uiteraard bierliefhebbers hier aan het juiste adres want bij elke burger staat er een bijpassend biertje op de kaart. Ze hebben ook een eigen uniek huisbiertje “Rostekop” wat verwijst naar Jilles die zelf Venetiaans blond is en hulde wil brengen aan alle roodharigen. Leuk toch? :) Wij kozen voor de Bacon Eli met bijpassend biertje en de Sweet Lucy burger met malse stukjes kipfilet en ananas (beide aan te raden!). De coleslaw salade die erbij geserveerd was, was iets minder ons ding maar daarvoor niet slecht.Bij een burger zijn de frietjes niet standaard inbegrepen en moet je nog 3 euro bijbetalen per portie. De porties zijn wel meer of voldoende voor 1 persoon dus het is eventueel aan te raden om 1 kommetje frietjes te delen met twee.Wat tenslotte wel jammer was, was dat de bediening wat koeltjes over kwam. Dit kan zeker beter. Ook ons eten kwam na bestelling eigenlijk iets té snel. Al bij al hebben we wel een positieve ervaring en komen we zeker nog eens terug."

Had a look at the menu which seemed very reasonable but decided to check out the Bella Italia across the road where prices were similar. I was pleased we decided on the Spaghetti House. The food was so beautifully cooked and seasoned For starters I had Burrata & Caponata which I highly recommend. My wife's starter was Calamari which she enjoyed very much. My main was Sea Bass, it was out of this world. My wife had Asparagus Risotto which I was privileged to taste, again wonderful and creamy. Salvatore looked after us. He kept us entertained, as Italian waiters seem to do, and chatted to us as though time didn't matter. We left the restaurant happy, then I asked my wife what the bill was, How did that happen I thought.12.5% service charge, £4 for a small bottle of water. Where did it say we were to be charged a service, apparently it was small print at the bottom left of the menu.So disappointed l.Date of visit: May 2019"

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;reputation;service;value,Staff attentive and no complaints. Food ok. Pizzas not bad althoug a bit heavy and doughy and a lot of crust with no topping. Large moretti(660ml) £7.95. Coke £2.75 a can. The worst part though is that they automatically add a 12.5% service charge which is stated on menu but is nevertheless a bit steep considering the prices. Wouldn't recommend particularly as you can get better value elsewhere.

After ordering our food, it came rather quickly. I ordered the spaghetti bolognese and my friend the lasagna. The lasagna came out on a plate, and it was in a black bowl which was scorching. The outer edges of the lasagna was incredibly hot but when he cut open the middle it was barely warm; clearly microwaved. Absolutely disappointing, we were hoping for some real cooked Italian food, not a microwave meal, especially for the price "

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;value,"We went on a quiet mid-week evening, had a long wait for our food to be served, which I was hoping would be worth it but sadly it wasn’t. It’s a steakhouse so we went for steak and to be fair that was the only good thing served on the cold plates. It was only partly saved at the end by the waiter not charging us for the awful steak sauces (we both choose different but standard ones and neither tasted like they should have) and a poor side. From reading the reviews it sounds like we were unlucky with the chef that was on the night we were there, but at fairly fully priced small portions the quality and consistency needs to be improved, so not worth chancing it."

We are Vegan so we were ecstatic to see they had options for us! The beyond burger (which they happily customised for me, took out the red onion and slaw) was absolutely amazing!

Vanwege de koude wind toch maar binnen gaan zitten recht tegenover de keuken. Hier vielen een aantal dingen op. De porties friet worden ruim van te voren gebakken en staan soms 5 tot 10 minuten onder de warmte lamp. Dit was dan ook terug te proeven omdat de friet slap was. Zowel de Red hot chili burger als de Meatlover waren echter prima burgers. We moesten helaas erg lang wachten op 1 van onze bestelde porties friet terwijl gezegd werd dat deze er snel aan kwam.Vanwege de drukte werd er weinig tijd besteed aan schoonmaken/opruimen. Zo zag de pas er erg smerig uit door losse frieten en ander etenswaar. Daarnaast kwam de bediening zeer gehaast over en leek het alsof er zoveel mogelijk gasten in zo kort mogelijke tijd moesten worden ‘afgehandeld’.Kortom: burgers prima, verdere ervaring was matig. "

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;environment;service,"We visited for a meal prior to theatre and took advantage of the set menu which for the money is amazing deal!! However the service was the major let down. Also wasn't a fan of sitting in the neighbouring tables pocket where I could hear every part of their conversation and vice Versa. Back to service we sat down. Neighbouring table arrived after us, had complimentary water provided, normal drinks and ordered starters before we were even attended too.The waiter stunk of garlic but took our order. We till got no complimentary water as every other table did.The starters came but we had no forks on the table so they had to get us some to start eating. Starters were nice.Main meal steak baguette was lovely and I would love to try main steak meal as the steak was amazing it really was tasty. The Other food going out looked good too.Again we seemed to wait ages forTable to be cleared. We were asked if we would like dessert and he asked if we could remember the choices (we did) so gave him our order but five minutes later he came back saying he had forgot what was it again. (Another 5 mins of listening to our next door neighbour talking about where she bought her outfit from in great detail)We got dessert which was tiny portion banoffee. The sundae wasn't partocularlu nice just plain ice cream, 2 pieces of brownie and some cream that tasted odd like it was over whipped.but for price fine.When the waiter returned we asked for bill. 5 mins later he came back to another table nearby and said oh I forgot your bill. By this time my partner had had enough and went to till to pay where the same waiter got sharp as my partner refused to agree to the tip on the machine. when my partner told him he felt the service was poor he argued a little rather than apologise.This was a massive let down as otherwise I would be raving about the value for money and would want to try a normal menu meal but afraid one staff member has made our first experience not a very good one. :-("

tripadvisor,nld,-1,food,"Ik kreeg een weinig gekruide, droge kipfilet voorgeschoteld van een dienster die blijkbaar alleen een volledig terras moest bedienen. Ook de additionele smaakloze tomaatsalsa kon op weinig bijval rekenen. Eén pluspunt: een koude cola zero mét ijs. Geen aanrader."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food;reputation,"It’s our first time visiting this restaurant and I have to say, I was impressed.. Greeted as soon as we entered and seated almost straight away.. next to a window which was nice.. the starter was beautiful and didn’t have to wait long for it either.. The main was just as good probably better, steak was melting in mouth and again didn’t have to wait long.. The only thing I had to only ask for was water on both starter and main to clean my fingers..  Desert was nice too..I would recommend this place to anyone. We had a lunch time slot which was a good time as food was good and on time plus not over crowded.. well done to all staff and chef. "
tripadvisor,fra,-1,environment;service;food,"Arrivée à 12h dans un restaurant vide de clients et de personnel.Nous étions seuls pendant 10min, le personnel était absent au rdc, en cuisine et à l’étage. La caisse et la cuisine étaient en libre accès si nous l’avions souhaité : stupéfiant !Une bassine de viande de volaille est à l’air libre en cuisine (chaîne de froid, protection des mouches ?) pendant plus de 10min jusqu’à ce que quelqu’un finisse par arriver.4 Burgers commandés (nous n’étions que nous 4 dans le restaurant) en évitant ceux contenant de la volaille et déjà une erreur. Ça arrive.Les burgers sont plutôt médiocres (servis à peine chaud, le pain est sec). Seules les frittes correctes sauvent l’honneur.Même s’il n’est pas catastrophique, passez votre chemin et préférez les autres burgers de Bastille qui sont tous bien meilleurs, parfois pour moins cher et où le service ne relève pas de l’aberration."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food,"We arrived here for dinner and the welcome was very inviting and the staff were really friendly and nice.The decor was great too. We ordered our main meals which were really nice and tasty, without too much of a wait either. We decided to have dessert so we asked for the menu, stated clearly at the top of the menu it read “all our desserts are made in house by our pastry chef” which sounded great, I much prefer a home made dessert rather than bought in frozen products, so this sold it for me, I definitely was going to order one. The desserts arrived at our table and there was no way they were home made! I work in the catering business so I know a bought in dessert when I see one. A real let down, after everything else was so good. I returned my dessert and wasn’t charged. Such a shame. "

Tegen mijn principes in toch een gevraagd om hem uit te bakken want rauw vlees zag ik niet zitten. Resultaat: nieuwe burger , wat wel zo netjes was maar... nogal zwartgeblakerd. Zeer jammer. Niet veel van gegeten.De eerlijkheid gebied mij te zeggen dat de uienringen en zoete aardappelfriet lekker waren.

Which suited us but maybe not for everyone. We had starters of fish goujons, spicy chicken wings and mushrooms. The food arrived hot and was very tasty.  The mains were butterfly chicken which was cooked really well and moist. My son had a the bean burger and was very tasty. Desserts we had were banofee pie, berry meringue and sundae. All  a lovely end to the meal. The waitress ,sorry did have her name ,was very attentive and provided a great service. The surroundings were beautiful and it used to be an old bank. Would definitely go again and worth the set menu definitely."

Surprisingly the restaurant was empty as it is a lovely looking place with big windows and comfy seating. The waiter was very welcoming however and seated us in a booth with an outside view. My sister decided to order from the two courses for £8.95 menu so ordered the pate and butterfly chicken whilst I spoilt myself to the main menu and ordered the prawn cocktail and beef Wellington.  Our drinks came quickly and not long after our starters arrived. Mine was divine, lots of plump juicy prawns in a delicious sauce and some fantastic bread on the side, I would definitely order that again. The pate was also very well received by my sister.  The mains came and mine was a huge individual Wellington, and absolutely delicious. I got a mushroom sauce with it which was also very tasty and my sister loved her chicken too.  We both really enjoyed both the food and the service and would without a doubt return. "
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food,"We visited last night to celebrate my husband’s birthday. We booked on line but had an extra guest so I phoned Charlottte to change the table. She rearranged the booking and accommodated my request for a round table. The restaurant was buzzing at 6pm on a Tuesday evening but we got attentive service from Charlotte who was lovely. Five of us had starters and mains, all were superb.  The ONLY sticking point was another waitress, with long dark hair and glasses, who could not have been more grumpy. She was grumpy to the point of rudeness and should perhaps reconsider her future in hospitality ! Even asking for extra napkins was too much.Our bill was incorrect as a vodka had been added, but Charlotte dealt with this efficiently and we left with full tummies after a great meal."

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;family_friendly;environment,I wasn't expecting much when I walked in on a quiet Sunday for lunch but the food really impressed me. We shared a meatball spaghetti and it was plenty to share. I loved it as it didn't have those strong tomato paste taste. Judged from the color you could tell they used real tomato rather than the tin sauce. Meatballs were handmade with good texture (unlike the IKEA ones which are overly processed). It was a nice lunch. Very children friendly. Free WifiFriendly staff

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service;reputation,"I decided to go to the spaghetti house because I always go past it on my way to oxford street. The manager let me and my friend sit wherever we would like. The service was very efficient. I had the king prawn and courgette pasta and it was delicious! The pasta was cooked perfectly not too soft and not a piece of pasta was stuck together. The prawns were amazing and overall was delicious and there was a lot of prawns which I loved. My friend had a pizza and she didn’t speak to me the whole time she was eating it (the sign that you’ve made a good meal). The only thing that made me not give this place 5 stars is the menu. The option of starters was very disappointing, it’s either bread or cheese, there was no crustaceans or meat and for a person like me that can’t eat cheese and I’m not a fan of bread it was abit naff really. It would’ve been better to have had a better range of pastas as well, a crab or a venison ravioli would be perfect on their menu. However the disappointing menu can be changed. My overall experience was great. "

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"Had a wonderful meal here some time ago. So to celebrate our granddaughters birthday she asked to have lunch here. Well for me it was truly a disappointment, Whilst my wife and granddaughter said their meal was okay, mine was definitely not. I decided on the fish with crushed peas and chips.  My fish was warm and sloppily wet. not moist as it should have been but wet. The batter was cooked so I can only assume that the fish was frozen and the fat to hot. So the batter cooked and the fish was warm and just defrosted. As for the peas, well it was a tiny pot and it held if I was lucky a desert spoon of crushed peas. Why are peas crushed? Are they afraid they may roll of the plate, or is this a new trendy way to serve them.  Whilst the chips were nice the meal as a whole was not, and they charged over 11 pounds for that. shall not bother to visit them again. I would get 100 times better in the local chip shop."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"Went for dinner and the starters were fantastic as usual. Not my first time there but probably the 4th. Unfortunately it's all very hit and miss. After a previous let down with seafood booked to go again on a Sunday night. Even though the restaurant was very empty the food was quite slow and my steak hideously over done. Due to the slow nature of the service no one came to ask about it for quite some time and I wasn't going to make the fuss of running around looking for someone. By the time I could make my issue my partner had almost finished his meal so when asked if I wanted anything else it seemed quite redundant to get a replacement and eat separately. Even though the bill was comped I left hungry and cooked at home eventually. Out of 4 expensive trips here, 2 have been significantly underwhelming making a 50% success rate not one I'll be searching for again."
tripadvisor,eng,1,service;food,"good  and tasty food   service is better but  though the crowd is not much the waiting period is little annoying.chicken ribs, steaks ,chiken wings ,burger,pork shank strawberry milk shake and all are tasty and delicious this is the fourth time we are visiting we really enjoyed we will come again after our visit to India"
tripadvisor,eng,1,food,"This is our second favorite local chain. Pricey, but good burgers. I would rather go here than go out of my way to get to 5 Guys. All in all, highly recommended. "
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"Before I begin I NEVER COMPLAIN Waited ages to be serviced only seemed like 1man doing everything Order a jacket potato and ribeye with veg  onion rings  Both our jackets had been there a while potato was so cold even the knob of butter wasn’t melting was all dry and shrunk round edges ,steak fatty chewy asparagus wasn’t washed was all grainy and bitty all floppy  All round poor effort and I won’t return now I don’t go out often but really fancied going as it was always a great place I blame the kitchen with slackness Front if house was amazing"
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;food,We had a day with friends shopping and drinking.We had booked the restaurant for lunch.Greeting and service was first class but as the restaurant got busy service got slowerI chose off the cheaper menu i got 3 haddock goujons for a starter nothing else for main course i got chicken which was fine but i chose seasonal vegetables i was not told that this consisted of asparagas only so i had a plate of asparagas plus chicken.One of our friends ate off the main menu which was fine.Overall we were slightly disappointed
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service,"This was my first visit to Middletons and I was not disappointed.  The restaurant itself is very nice and spacious and the staff were friendly.  The food came in good time and was very tasty.  The portion size was perfect and the choice of sides were good too.  It is a shame they charge you for steak sauce and considering they charge you, they should fill the pots up more.Other than that, a very enjoyable evening and would definitely go back."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service,Came here quite late in the evening and the staff couldn't do any more for you. They assisted with recommendations on the menu and were very attentive at all times. 
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;food,"We visited on Saturday for lunch with friends, and all ate from the great value set menu. The place was busy when we arrived but it wasn't long before it was clear they couldn't cope with the number of customers. The wait staff were rushed off their feet but food just wasn't coming out of the kitchen quickly enough. One hour wait for starter and nearly another hour til the main for a lunch set menu isn't good enough and you wouldn't expect to be seated for this long. Once the food came it was great, between us we had garlic mushrooms, pate, haddock goujons and chicken wings and all were great. Mains of minute steak, steak ciabatta and burger were all very good and cooked as requested. Peterborough tends to be busy on a Saturday lunch time and added to this there was a large concert at the football stadium, and it just looked like they hadn't planned for it. We were offered a small discount on the food on the bill which was appreciated but to be in a restaurant for approx 2.5 hours for a set lunch is about double what you'd expect. We've been here several times and love the food and never had service issues before, so would definitely come back but hopefully this is something they look at and learn from. "
tripadvisor,eng,1,food;service,"Once again I've had a great lunch at Kricket. My beloved mustard greens were gone, but luckily they were replaced with salad greens, which were so succulent.My waitress was, once again, the lovely Celeste who looked after me wonderfully. I definitely couldn't have managed any dessert after eating all I did; Keralan Chicken, Salad Greens, and Leek and Potato Paratha. And the Croquettes as well. Everything was wonderful."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;value,"Lovely service, come here for lunch sometimes for the set menu and it’s very tasty good portions and price, when asked about a certain dish I got a prompt reply with an honest opinion which I find is great! Thanks see you soon :) "

tripadvisor,eng,1,food;value;environment,"I've been here twice now, and both times were satisfying. The first time, the waiter wasn't that friendly, but I am guessing he just had a bad day since he was very cheery the second time I visited. The burgers are really good, only a bit expensive if you are a student."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service,"Had the spicy prawns followed by Middleton burger. Burger was tasty but out of proportion with huge bun which made it look small. I would prefer a double burger with bacon and perhaps a fried egg, but it wasn't on the menu, perhaps match the bun size next time. I think you need to have a couple of sides with the meal. I had a cocktail as it seemed better value than the beer. Service was good and very friendly. I saw other diners meals, it was busy and I saw enough of their meals to make me want to come back sometime"
tripadvisor,fra,1,experience;service,A great place. We only wanted a quick snack but Jess treated us like we wanted a 3 course meal. Thank you Jess. Definitely a 5* place
tripadvisor,nld,-1,service;food,"Hier met een groep vrienden wat wezen eten. Service was beneden niveau glazen etc werden niet weg gehaald. Personeel was zeer gestrest over de enorme drukte terwijl het restaurant voor nog geen 1/4e vol zat, beetje vreemd. Burgers lekker maar zeker niet bijzonder friet die er bij geserveerd werd was slap. Al met al geen hele goede totaal ervaring voor mij. Zou hier niet terug naar toe gaan. "
tripadvisor,eng,-1,food;service,"When we ordered, the waiter said we did not have enough dishes, we ordered more which were not necessary. A bad case of ‘up selling’. The dishes came out slowly, we kept chasing as we were off to the theatre, they didn’t seem to care, we paid the bill as we ate and had been there in plenty of time. The food is delicious, the food is expensive for what it was, the service was slow and not interested apart from the concern we ordered more!"
tripadvisor,eng,1,service,"Young Lady welcomed and hosted us, won all our hearts despite 25 min.waiting (which is nothing for a saturday lunch visit without a reservation). Anywhere she goes we follow...:) Food was exquisite to our taste, all wines selected in harmony with the food. I tried burnt garlic in home with fresh sea asparagus (Turkish: ""börülce"") right after our return (tarka dal inspirations:)"

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,"It was a Sunday evening and we wanted something light. We didn’t have a booking but there were a few tables available. This place appears to be one of a chain of restaurants. In spite of that, the food was tasty and the service prompt"
tripadvisor,eng,0,experience;food;service,"Ate here this afternoon and was so disappointed. Calamari was awful, deep fried and rubbery with a terrible batter that was more like saw dust. Spaghetti was mediocre. Good service and great location but the food was awful. I’m guessing they don’t need to rely on repeat business. "
tripadvisor,nld,-1,value;food;service,"Wat is het nut van het kunnen kiezen van een saus bij je spaghetti als de verkeerde saus wordt geserveerd ? Bovendien wordt de spaghetti geserveerd zonder brood. De drank (€ 2.70 voor een cola, € 5.50 voor een karaf water van 75 cl) is veel te duur"

Is ene beetje een ritueel aan het worden.Tezamen met 2 vrienden de overheerlijke Bleating Eddie (maar in m'n hart zal hij altijd de OG Goatcheese burger zijn). Manmanman, wat een lekkere burger, lekker stuk vlees met een 'goei lap' geitekaas erboven op. Dit met frietjes (of onion rings) erbij zorgt voor een stevige maaltijd dat ervoor zorgt dat je in de cinema geen snacks meer moet bijkopen!Go now!Ik snap niet allemaal die azijnpissers hier die het lef hebben om de zaak 1 ster te geven. Vooral die Heerom kerel. Wat een 'toffe' gast om mee weg te gaan. opgemerkt in z'n review dat hij de enige aan tafel was die overal een probleem mee had. Niet altijd die 1 ster reviews geloven!Al 7-8 keer geweest, nooit een slechte ervaring gehad!!"

Fries, coleslaw and selection of beers all good too.Highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to break the bank!"
tripadvisor,fra,-1,food,"C'est à mon sens très mauvais. Un peu moins que du fast food, mais c'est clairement du même genre. J'y suis une fois retourné complètement soûl, c'était toujours aussi peu intéressant."
tripadvisor,ita,1,value;food,"Hamburger fantasiosi, non tutte le versioni sono gradevoli. Spesso un po' dolciastri. Menu di birre niente di che rispetto al fatto ritrovarsi nella patria delle birre di alto livello. Gli hamburger sono piuttosto cari (da 15 euro in su). Patatine buone. Ne fanno anche una versione dolce. Nel complesso lo consiglio, ma non è proprio il top per gli amanti di un burger tradizionale."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food,"This was a return visit to Middleton’s and once more we were impressed by the service, offered today by Jess and Amanda.  The food was excellent and Chloe cooked the steaks exactly as we had requested.  Many chefs cook meat the way they see fit.  We had a relaxed, unhurried meal with family.One thing to be aware of is that the flooring in the toilets is a little slippery."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service,"We had a lovely meal at lunchtime. This was myself and parents. They were very accommodating and particularly I would like to mention Mark, the waiter who served us. He was smiley, friendly and very attentive with all aspects of the meal."

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,This restaurant has nice cuts of beef and knows how to cook them. That sounds simple but plenty of places manage to get it wrong. Setting is nice and staff are friendly - but mostly it’s five stars for the meat.

tripadvisor,eng,1,food;reputation,Perfect for group of people with vegans since it has 2 burger options and a few other side dishes and finger food.Meat burgers seemed really good as well from what I heard from my friends
tripadvisor,eng,-1,food;service;environment,"We had to sit down at a dirty table. The table was not cleaned. When we get the bottles of drinks, we had to ask for glasses ourselves after 15 minutes and where the other drink went. Milkshake could not be served as well as the dessert because they had no icecream. (But the still placed it on the receipt). Burger tastes ok, but that's it. We will not come back anymore."

Others had the Bavet spag bol and apparently that was delicious too. Very friendly staff and of course nice beer! Would definitely go back if ever in Ghent again."

tripadvisor,fra,1,food,"Nous étions 6. Nous nous sommes tous régalés. Les frites sont très bonnes avec la mayo maison aux herbes. Nous avons goûté au Beyond Burger, un burger vege dont le ""steak"" est censé donner l'illusion de la viande... Et en effet, c'était près perturbant ! Texture, goût et visuel, ça ressemble tellement à de la viande qu'on a vérifié à 2 fois. On hesiterai presque à le manger ! Mais cela fait un burger pas sec du tout et très bon. L'accueil est également de mise, notre serveuse a été très souriante ! On recommande. "
tripadvisor,eng,-1,value;food,"Hello fellow travelers, this review is an honest and straightforward review. I am pasta lover and everywhere I travel I ate them. This place is located in a beautiful square, the design is quite friendly giving the impression of the home feeling. The pasta quality is low very low, I have ordered cheesy pasta with 4 types of cheese - I don’t know where those 4 type disappeared as my pastas has only a mix of milk, lots of flour and some cheap cheese. The topping was also poor, some inferior quality of parmesan that had no taste. I really thought I will have some good pasta but I was wrong. The service is ok, young folks who just got hired there and don’t know much of their responsibilities but at least they are cute and somehow empathetic. The lady who attended my table knew that I didn’t like my dish but didn’t do anything consistent to fix this mess. If you want to eat good food, go somewhere else where pasta, parmigiano and cheese are real 😊."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;reputation;service;food,Not being a fan of Indian food I was a little apprehensive to visit Kricket but could not have had a better meal. The waiter took time to check with the chef which dishes were and were not spicy. The food is served tapas style - both the date and pistachio bread and sweet potato truly delicious. Highly recommended !

However on arrival my wife heard someone on another table complain, unbeknown to me we proceeded to order! both starters were very nice, then the mains 2 Sunday Roasts we good, my wife had Beef Wellington which was tasty but a bit chewy (warm) then it went to pot !! Prime Surf & Turf - with Shrimp turned up the Fillet was dry and cold to touch, the Shrimps no better !! This was promptly sent back, when it returned the steak was another cut but no better in fact i left it .... this was deducted from the bill and an additional desert was also credited. We wont be returning !!!!"

A bit disappointed with the fact that even though we pre-booked our food, there were a few of the sides that were unavailable.  That aside the meals were excellent and very well cooked quality meat. The desserts were lovely, especially the sticky toffee pudding! I would definitely go there again."

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;value;service,"First visit to this restaurant & curious to see what had been done to ""Jamie's"".  Struggled to open front door, which seems very heavy. Offered table immediately & not herded together with other diners, one of my personal hates! Drinks order taken & arrived quickly. Food order taken but took a bit longer to arrive. Not in any rush so not a problem. I chose from the £9.95 section as I am a non-meat eater & that suited me fine. My starter, the haddock goujons, seemed small (only 2 pieces) but my companions had the brie wedges which were much more generous. My goats cheese tart didn't amount to much, puff pastry square with onions & tomato & a VERY small piece of goats cheese, but was served with asparagus which I love. Pleasant but not outstanding. The others ordered steak & blue cheese burger & both were very pleased with their meal. My dessert, a fruit pavlova, was really small, with defrosted berries & a thumb nail sized blob of cream. The other dessert, a creme brulee, was cold & the caramel topping had been made separately & stuck on top. It was too hard to eat. Our server, Stephan, was excellent & happily answered our questions. I think we will visit again, but I will choose from the main menu to see if the quality, & portion size,is better than the 3 course bargain offer!"

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food;reputation,"I am lucky enough to live within a short walk of Middletons so I've visited on many occasions with various groups of friends and family, from busy Saturday lunchtimes to midweek dinners. I have always found the service to be warm and attentive plus you never feel rushed so you can really take your time to enjoy the atmosphere. The food is consistently excellent, with a special mention to the £9.95 Set Menu which offers three perfectly sized portions at an astonishing price from Monday - Saturday! The restaurant is located just around the corner from Colchester High Street so be sure to visit next time you're in town."

Sit outside and enjoy the life of the plaza. The service is kind and attentive, but they sure can be busy - hence expect some wait. "
tripadvisor,eng,1,food,"This is located in the small strip of shops directly opposite the Tin Tin mural in Brussels Midi station. If you're arriving by Eurostar then it's right next to the escalators/stairs where you come down into the station. There is ready made food and drinks to buy, plus a food counter for hot food. i had the falafel wrap which was very decent but slightly on the bland side. But I'm loving these healthy fast food places that are springing up. The last thing you need on a long journey is highly processed food and endless lattes making you feel terrible."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,service,"My boyfriend and I visited ellis on the last night of our holiday to Amsterdam, we had been a few nights previous and the service and food was excellent, however when we visited this night that was not the case. We sat inside and had to wait around 15 minutes until we had to get the attention of the waitress. After making our order we waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive. During this time we saw several families and couples give up and walk out. We had ordered nachos for starters however they never arrived. One particular waiter approached us several times with the wrong order, clearly not knowing what table was what. When some of our order finally arrived, my boyfriends burger was extremely raw and he couldn’t eat it. We gave up trying to eat our meals and raised our complaints with the waiter at the till. He took the nachos off our order and didn’t charge us for the drinks but in my opinion as only 2 bites were taken out the burgers we shouldn’t have been charged for any of it. There was plenty of staff on hand but many seemed to be just going out for smoke breaks."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,service,"I was on vacation with my wife just after we had merried. I am vegetarian since 7 years and decided to try for  first time the beyond burger with the no gluten bread, unfortunately I am alletgic to gluten. So the 9 th June I went to Ellis burger. I can say that the burger was  unbelivebly tasting like meat  and the bread was one of the best I ever had since years.  I remeber the waitress, a black lady with long hair, and I remember ne telling her it was unbelivebly tasting like meet. After a couple of days I went back to eat again the beyond burger before goibg back home and that time the burger was completely different. I realized that the waitress first time gave me a real meet burger with a normal bread. I was shocked!!! I felt psicologically bad bad for eating meet and physically for eating the gluten bread. I was so shocked. I didn t know what to do and the first waitress wasn t there to complain. I still feel very bad about that, I hope it will not happend again to someone else. "

The Brixton location does have a smaller menu, but there is plenty of deliciousness to go around. Lots of gluten free options too. It’s worth making a booking in advance."

tripadvisor,spa,-1,reputation,"Comimos en Bavet de Bruselas, en la plaza, pedimos dos espaguetis y una botella de agua. La camarera trajo la comida y bebida a otras mesas que llegaron después, íbamos con una niña pequeña por lo que tuve que decirle a la chica que sinos podia traer el agua por lo menos y resulta que no lo habia ni apuntado. Trae el agua, botella de cristal de 75cl, abierta, sin tapon. Nos danos cuenta que la botella esta rellenada, el cuello de la botella por dentro sucio y cositas negras, podrían al menos limpiar las botellas porque cobran 5,50€ por una botella rellenada, nunca había visto eso... además sabía a grifo.... después de esperar un buen rato tuve que preguntar de nuevo a la camarera que dónde estaban nuestros espaguetis?? En resumen, dos platos de espaguetis boloñesa y botella de agua rellenada 28,50€. Los espaguetis estan bien, normales... recomiendo no pedir agua."

Main meal portion was if anything smaller than the starter, the toasted sourdough was so hard it was impossible to cut let alone bite!

Om kwart na 6 op een zondagavond besteld om 1 uur later half lauwe burgers voorgeschoteld te krijgen. Dit terwijl er slechts 3 tafels volzet waren waarvan er 2 reeds hun eten gekregen hadden.Als vegetariër kan ik hun uitgebreid vegetarisch en vegan aanbod alleen maar toejuichen, alleen verwacht je echt wel meer smaak voor een hamburger van €16. Ik had de curry sally genomen, maar de currysmaak overheerste zo hard dat er voor de rest niets meer te smaken was. De frietjes, die als extra sidedish werden aangerekend, hadden nog de meeste smaak van al.Bovendien staat er op de voordeur dat je enkel kan betalen met payconiq en betaalkaart, maar als je dan wil betalen via je smartphone is het niet meer mogelijk via payconiq."

WELL MY STEAK CAME BACK JUST MORE GRILLED ON THEE OUTSIDE AND STILL RAW IN THE MIDDLE,I JUST COULD NOT BELIEVE IT,, ALONG WITH THE VERY VERY CREMATED  ONION RINGS AND SWEET POTATOES I SAT THERE SO DISILLUSIONED, AND MY PARTNER COULD ONLY EAT HER STEAK TOO,,, AGAIN STAFF APOLOGETIC BUT COULD GIVE NO EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THE CHEF COULD NOT COOK A STEAK TO THE CUSTOMERS LIKING OR WHY THE SIDE ORDERS WERE CREMATED AND UNEATABLE AND US THE ONLY ONES IN THERE,????

Buona la carne e il pesce, i primi e le pizze. A fine pasto, fatevi viziare con crescentine e Nutella. In sintesi, affidabilità e posizione strategica. "
tripadvisor,eng,-1,service,"My friend and I visited Ellis burger yesterday evening and it was the WORST experience and service I have ever had. The staff were rude especially the so called ‘manager to be’. My friends food arrived first and I had to ask 3 times for my food when they came over with 2 burgers neither of them were what I ordered, they then said it’s on its way, after 1 whole hour I still didn’t receive my food. By which time my friend had finished her whole meal. When I complained to the waiters they were incredibly rude and aggressive. The only person who was attentive and understanding was the waitress who admitted the behaviour from the waiters was unacceptable. They never bought my burger and then said my order was taken wrong, and did not apologise or rectify it by bringing me my burger. To top it off they did not bring our starters and then tried to charge us for them. They then said the kitchen was closed so I couldn’t have my meal WHICH WAS A LIE! If you want good service, nice people....Do visit Ellis burgers"

Als Vegetarierin habe ich mich darüber gefreut, mehrere vegetarische/vegane Alternativen zu haben. Den Entscheidung fiel auf den Nutty Molly. Mein Freund aß den Hot Gillian. Beides würde mit kleinen Salat serviert. Die Pommes müsste man separat bestellen. Dazu gab es bei uns das Hausbier und die Homemade Lemonade.Alles war wirklich lecker und von guter Qualität. Kritikpunkte: die Einrichtung im Gebäude ist zwar top, im Innenhof hätten wir uns aber noch Sitzkissen auf den Metallstühlen gewünscht und etwas Deko.  Ein wenig fegen hätte auch gut getan und an einigen Blumentöpfen waren Spinnweben. Die Preise fanden wir auch etwas hoch angesetzt (fast 50 € für 2 Burger, einmal Pommes und ein Bier und eine Limonade)."

The place has a clean, fresh, welcoming atmosphere, the service is good (thank you Elise, and chef Jonny) and sometimes ""above and beyond"" - the waitress tried to help me with a WhatsApp problem on my phone, then found the manager, who sorted it for me!   The lunch menu is excellent value at 3 courses for £9.95, the food is nicely presented and tasty.  We have pretty much worked our way through most of the options, but I gather that there is a new menu starting soon.  We're planning to make a trip there one evening soon, to try the main menu."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,food;experience,"Well,  after so much noise at Kricket from friends, colleagues, Timeout and just about every Google search I'd ever done - I finally had the chance to go (Sunday 16/06) and, in hindsight, I wish I'd just torn my money up, insulted my friends and eaten alone at home - it would have been more fun. So let's start - Service was fine, not particularly attentive or pro-active but fine for a Sunday. Atmosphere... I had to double-check I was in a restaurant - it was fullish but about as dead as the beef I was about to suffer through. The beef was almost comically tough, like a leather placeholder had been served as though they'd forgotten to cook enough for service. I waited 5 minutes for the sides only to realise that they were already on my plate! A pound coin-sized serving of each served as a sample to the flavourless combinations that might actually be full dishes for any lucky punter visiting on a regular service day - for this, I count myself lucky that I only had to taste, rather than eat, the apparent 'side' for my meal. To top it off, it was cold - zero f**ks were given and zero enjoyment was had. I didn't complain on the day but I should've. Maybe the small plates and regular a la carte are more their thing - Sorry guys, but I'll never know. Service 3/5. Food 0.5/5. No atmosphere.p.s. One of my friends is Vegan and had the veg option - I can't speak for her, but £15 for a pathetic portion of cold butternut squash is a joke."

My burger was ok, but not better than that, since the chicken in contained had been over-cooked and was dry as a consequence."

tripadvisor,eng,1,food;experience,"Being a restaurant owner 30+ years I am very picky and as usual, I will give you an honest review. Hope this helps. My daughter lives very close and she invited us to dinner at this restaurant. She just kept saying Dad, you will LOVE the views and the food. They do not take reservations so we went about 5:30 and it was quiet and we sat outside (highly recommend) and were greeted by this outgoing, happy and positive waitress. Beautiful day, clear sky and about 78 degrees. The first thing you realize is that as you come up to the building it is up high. Sitting here, overlooking a quarry with huge fountain and beside it a golf course plus off in the distance the entire view of Boston skyline... WOW. That's all you can say.... seriously,... just wow. I would imagine a sunset to be breathtaking and view of Boston at night awesome. The appetizer was shrimp cocktail (see pic) with 12 medium size shrimp. Shrimp were fresh, firm but for my taste cocktail sauce a tad bland but still they were good.I asked if they could do fish n chips since it was not on the menu and they obliged! Perfectly fried haddock, delicious slaw ( i am a slaw critic) and fries just right. My wife got fish taco appetizer which was great for dinner. Too full for dessert but the quality of everything else was superb so I will have to return for the treats another time. Just too full. So, I feel I have to say this is a MUST VISIT. View to die for and food really really good. Service was perfect. Price a smidge high but competitive.They do valet parking but we parked up in the parking lot since it was nice out. Go early or you may have to wait. Enjoy and I hope this helps."

Helaas waren de tafeltjes buiten niet goed schoon en miste er her en der menu kaarten/ peper & zout waardoor je genoodzaakt bent bij buren te lenen. Kwaliteit van het eten vond ik prima maar niet uitzonderlijk. Wat ik een gemiste kans vind is dat er niet gevraagd wordt of je burger medium of doorbakken wil. Voor zwangeren/ ouderen is dit gezondheids technisch zoizo niet handig. Ik hou niet van een medium hamburger en heb dus een deel laten staan, jammer. "

I come here really often to study and work while having a coffee, but today he interrupted me cause he found a snack wrapping on my notebook from a snack that I ate before. He took the small wrapping and told me that I should never bring something like this in there. I told him that I already order coffees and cake form Cofee Company (which were next to me btw). However, he was that rude to tell me that he didn't care and that I'm not even allowed to eat my snacks there. Intruding guests' privacy is worst than eating a small snack while drinking your coffee. Plus, he just saw the wrapping of something that I had before. Imagine if he actually saw me eat my chocolate bar. Never again there."

Bij de vraag of de Nachos lekker waren, werd geantwoord werd geantwoord “dat weet ik niet, ik lust geen nacho’s . Toen we eindelijk hadden kunnen bestellen, duurde het erg lang voordat het eten kwam. We kregen geen bestek en het eten werd aan de verkeerde tafel bezorgd. De bediening was rampzalig, gelukkig was de hamburger heerlijk!"
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food,"We went on a saturday evening and it was very busy. The tables were pushed very close together so we were practically on other diners laps but, nevertheless it was still a good experience. The food is very good - unique and tasty. We really enjoyed the parathas, the daal, the duck leg kathi. I was really excited about the fried chicken but it was so salty we had to leave most of it. Maybe it was an off night. I felt the samphire pakoras needed a little more seasoning and less of the sweet sticky sauce but all minor points for a restaurant that I look forward to visiting again."

Also a vast beer collection (with the matching glasses, as per usual in Belgium!) About 10 varieties of burgers, some chicken sandwiches, basic American food. Cool atmosphere and we had great service. I will mention this FUN FACT: If you are a ""ginger"" and you ask, you get a Free house beer to go home with. Apparently the owner is a Ginger and sympathizes :)"

tripadvisor,eng,-1,food;service,We went here for a casual dinner and waited over 40 minutes for food. We were casually told there was a 'problem in the kitchen' and our food would arrive in 5 minutes' time. When our food eventually arrived it was stone cold and when we asked for it to be warmed we were coldly told 'I don't have time to deal with you' from one member of staff and then another said we could have our food microwaved. We eventually left because our second round of drinks didn't even arrive and by that time we had waited over an hour for food. The staff weren't fussed and watched us walk away. I would not recommend this place it's a complete joke and the service is the worst I have ever received. Please avoid.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"Me and my wife came here for her birthday with some other couples. I've been here before and never really had any problems. Starters arrived no problem, when the mains arrived the seafood mixed grill I had ordered contained calamari which looked like it had spent a week in the fryer. The waiters couldn't work out which cut of steak was which nor how it had been asked for (rare, medium, well done). My pregnant wife's steak which she had asked to come medium was dripping with blood and my friends meal arrived 15 minutes later only after I prompted the waiter. My wife sent her rare cold steak back and when it arrived back it was still rare and dripping in oil. We spoke to the manager and we were told they would take my wife's steak off the bill, which should have been given as she couldn't eat it. That was it, an entire evening ruined which left everyone annoyed and dissatisfied. "

Entrambi buonissimi ma le patatine sono qualcosa di eccezionale, sono le più buone assaggiate fin'ora in Belgio.Consigliatissimo 👍"
tripadvisor,eng,0,experience;food;service,"Two large groups were booked for a Saturday lunch of which I was in one - a party of 16. The waiting staff didn't know where to send which party so random people turned up in our section and some of our family turned up in theirs, not a great start but we sorted out between us.OK, first things first, I am not a 'foodie' and not a fussy eater but having just looked at the food pictures posted above I wish some of that had turned up at our meal. The bruschetta avacado was basically green goop on toast with a few seeds on top -visually off putting - my wife and I exchange glances and she whispered 'are you really going to eat that?' (I ate some of it). The prawn cocktail was straight out of a classic 70's dinner party but very tasty. The salmon was good but the chicken was dry (overcooked) and the tomato/basil base it was in looked suspiciously like it was out of a can but it was fairly tasty so overall OK.  My daughters both had margherita pizzas, one pizza had very little cheese topping and one was ok (if an Italian restaurant can't get a margherita pizza right you know it's not good). Nearly forgot about the side dish of rosemary potatoes - turned up luke-warm and limp and very quickly turned to cold mush (no one had more than a forkful before politely declining a second). Thank god they couldn't mess up the profiteroles,the ice cream or the coffee (but they did forget my wife's latte), however, the people who had tiramisu were disappointed and several were left unfinishedLots of food left over which the waiter scrapped into a bin behind the counter before sending empty plates back to the kitchen (does the chef know how much is thrown away?).The waiter was very friendly and personable and his humour made up for an otherwise generally forgettable meal.Sure Spaghetti House could do better"
tripadvisor,eng,-1,food;service;value,"The actual food here wasn't bad. We ordered fries as a side-- since none of chicken dishes come with sides of any kind -- which Awere also not bad. The service, on the other hand, was AWFUL. We counted 6 employees. 2 laying down in one of the stalls inside, another seated nearby with his cellphone, another 2 outside seated smoking and one young woman who we spotted walking around once or twice. When I dragged one of the employees to the counter to pay my bill I found out a dish that is listed as 13,00€ for 2 people to share on the menu was actually per person. This was not stated on the menu and our server neglected to mention this while taking our order. That chicken was definitely mediocre at best and in no way worth the price. Definitely go to one of the fuller restaurants next door."
tripadvisor,eng,1,food;service,We went here for dinner and were seated right away even with a group of 6. The food was good but the service was slow. They would not split our check either. Tip: they had the best fries I have ever had in my life. Order the chili cheese fries appetizer. It come with spicy dip and it is really good.

I was so pleased to find this reasonably priced restaurant near my hotel. The service was friendly and polite without being formal. The food was excellent. I’ll not detail my very simple order. However, the quality of the tomato sauce at this restaurant was far superior to anything I was served on my business trip to Naples, Italy just 2 weeks ago. I would gladly eat here again and I’m sure eating with a larger group, sharing items and building multiple courses would be a great dining experience. "

tripadvisor,eng,-1,service;food,"Today we had two burgers at Ellis. One red hod chili and one Ellis special 2.0, fries and Cole slaw. For drinks we wanted an ice tea and a milkshake, but they were out of ice. Later we were told they were also out of bacon. They managed to find the bacon (or go buy it), and 35 minutes after out order, we got two undercooked burgers, we had to ask for knife and fork, and though we asked for mayo 3 times, we never got any. Once this was a decent burger place, but I'm going to Manhattans next time."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;environment;food,"I like Indian food and so go to Indian restaurants at least once or twice a month. Kricket is the most unusual Indian restaurant I've been to. First, the restaurant is very popular. They open at 5 p.m. for dinner and there was a pretty good line before opening the Saturday night my husband and I went. However, we had no trouble grabbing a couple of seats at the counter (which is more an eating counter than a bar). I highly recommend sitting at the counter, which was comfortable and interesting. You can see how the food is made and the very friendly staff is delighted to chat with you about the process, the ingredients and the sort of Kricket food philosophy. It became a bit of a show and added to our enjoyment. The entree portions are tapas-sized, so four dishes to share between two people is a good idea. You can even go five dishes if you're really hungry. The dishes were very cutting-edge, but we really liked most of them. Not your ordinary Indian food, but with the flavors and ingredients of India. One dish wasn't to my taste, but that was just my taste preference. The restaurant atmosphere is also very hip. In all, a fun and delicious evening."

I had three three course menu which is fantastic value and also meant I could have some sides (salad and onion rings). The garlic mushrooms were lovely, and not served scalding hot as some places do. The steak was cooked perfectly for me and well flavoured. The dessert - Choc Brownie sundae left something to be desired but was a nice little treat. The gin cocktail was really delicious and nicely presented. Charlotte is a lovely waitress - managing busy restaurant, great polite service but also taking a moment to chat. Charlotte you are a credit to the restaurant! Thank you"
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;environment,The menu had a lot of choice. The staff where polite but they weren’t friendly or jolly. They have crammed in way to many tables into a small room. Our table was inches away from the couple next to us. It was very uncomfortable. There was no atmosphere as I think everyone else was aware that we where all practically huddled together. It felt like a dining hall. The food wasn’t great. I ordered calzone. The filling was very small 2/3 of the dough was just that dough with no filling in it at all and it was gooey and not piping hot. I’ve had better at Frankie and Bennys. Wouldn’t recommend here at all.

Terras aanwezig (binnenkoer) maar persoonlijk vond ik deze niet echt gezellig dus hebben we binnen gezeten met zicht op de Vismarkt. Mooie kaart met tal van heerlijke burgers, maar ook slaatjes en vegetarische opties. De burger met beenham & spek was echt wel heel erg lekker en de beefburger met gesmolten kaas en tomatensaus was ook lekker (mss was de tomatensaus hier wel wat overheersend), dit alles met een fris witloofslaatje en een frietje. Echt wel heel lekker. Minder vond ik persoonlijk het leeggoed gedeelte aan de bar, de keuken rechtover de toiletten en de staat van de toiletten op zich. De bediening gebeurd door hele jonge mensen, vaak afwezig in de zaal/service, maar die wel heel vriendelijk zijn."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;value,"We all went for the pasta. Although it was slightly undercooked, it wasn't to bad. What I don't like is the automatic 12.5% service charge added to the bill. Very excessive. I completely understand reasturants adding this when there is a party of 6+ but when there are only 3 of you this is a problem. When we asked for the service charge to be taken off the bill the waitress seemed shocked and asked why. What ever happened to tipping afterwards? "
tripadvisor,nld,-1,food,"Zeer teleurstellende ervaring. Wij zijn 2 vegetariers en waren  aangenaam verrast dat er meerdere veggie opties beschikbaar waren. Wij kozen de veggie volovant en de veggie pitta, met vooraf nog veggie apertiefhapjes. Toen het hoofdgerecht geserveerd was, hadden wij al meteen onze bedenkingen bij de pitta. Deze leek ons niet echt veggie te zijn, maar de serveerster verzekerde ons dat het veggie was. Wat dus niet zo bleek te zijn ... Zowel qua textuur als smaak zijn wij zeer zeker dat we kip geserveerd kregen. De volovant bestond uit veggie kippenstukjes (wat wel veggie was, en dus nogmaals het contrast met de pitta aantoonden). Maar de balletjes die erbij geserveerd werden waren, opnieuw, niet vegetarisch. We waren even aan het twijfelen, aangezien sommige veggie gerechten nogal dichtbij vlees-smaak in de buurt durven komen, maar de smaak was volledig anders dan de eerdere veggie balletjes die we kregen en smaakte wel zeker naar gehakt. Geen idee of dit bewuste of onbewuste fouten waren (het feit dat we 2x vlees kregen, met een half-veggie gerecht doet ons twijfelen), maar wij komen zeker niet meer terug! Als je veggie aanbiedt, zorg er dan voor dat het ook 100% vegetarisch is! Misschien een tip voor de keuken, bij het bereiden en serveren van veggie gerechten: maak een visueel onderscheid (vb door vlaggetjes) tussen de vegetarisch en niet-vegetarische gerechten om fouten te vermijden. Het personeel weet duidelijk wat vegetarisch, en klanten krijgen al een extra geruststelling dat ze geen vlees geserveerd krijgen."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"Pre booked lunch for 15 people. Arrived on time for our 12.30 table booking, place wasn't particularly full, maybe 5 or 6 tables of people. Took 15 minutes to take a drinks order and managed to miss someone. Starters (only 2 people out of the 15) arrived after about 25 mins and looked small but were part of the meal deal so OK I guess. After an hour of waiting for the mains, we were told our food was coming after we asked (not one of the waiters had come to let us know they were having trouble, or were busy etc) and was on the pass, only for that food to be taken to another table. Our food finally came out an hour and 10 minutes after we had arrived. The two fish mains were sent back to the kitchen as inedible as the fish was so over cooked as was a butterfly piripiri chicken. Some of the mains were advertised as ""All individual steaks are garnished with field mushroom, crushed garden peas & roast tomato"", no mushrooms, peas were to be seen and an uncooked half tomato was the only garnish on the plate.Two steaks were sent back to the kitchen to be cooked further as despite being ordered medium well done and medium, both were far too rare. These were then brought back to the table without any of the sides that had been on them plates sent back, and when queried a couple of portions of greasy fries were sent out along with another uncooked tomato half.Several of the group had ordered a 3 course meal and the desserts which arrived again took forever to arrive and were of measly proportions. I certainly wouldn't have paid full price for them but as part of the meal deal I guess it was OK value. Again I didn't have one so can't comment on the taste.It's the first time personally I've been there, and would never return. Shame, as the décor and the idea seems good, the execution of it however is just dire and having a waitress roll her eyes when asked why it was taking so long having prebooked and reply ""we had other people come in at the same time""...Wow. No restaurant has ever faced people wanting Lunch at Lunchtime before..."

Veggie taco's daarentegen was grote portie met 3 stuks maar veel te veel sojasaus waardoor eentonig. Fijn is wel dat je salade / groenten apart kan bestellen, evenals aardappelgerechten naar keuze. Bediening was vriendelijk.Niet aan te raden op een zwoele zomeravond want slechts 8 plaatsen op terras waardoor wij binnen zaten.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"As you can imagine from the title, this will not be the most favourable review of a business, particularly one that I had previously heard raved about in both business and social circles. As part of a large group, and as a goodbye lunch for a colleague, our lunch was pre-booked many days in advance, however the organisation we were met with certainly left a lot to be desired.First, i'll start with the positives, there being very few from our trip. The aesthetics of the restaurant are very attractive, a far cry from the drudgy old bank that used to reside. We were not greeted by anyone immediately as we entered, however we were seated relatively swiftly, with perhaps 5 or so other tables of diners in occupation.Now we move on to where things fall downhill. Rapidly. (Or not depending on your interpretation of irony). Once seated, it was perhaps a good 15, maybe 20 minutes before our drinks orders were taken, where I was subsequently entirely ignored by the server, having to catch him on his way back with the drinks some time later. Fast forward another 10-15 minutes and the two (yes, two, out of 15) of our party that ordered starters were finally approached with their food. I believe it was fish goujons, and chicken wings, both small portions but as part of the three-course-deal this was not considered a major issue. Now we shall fast forward again, perhaps a further 30 minutes give or take, where we were now having to chase up with the staff where our main courses were, to be advised that they were in final preparation and would be with us shortly, the waiter even gesturing to the dishes being plated up in the serving area visible.Now, as a large group of now very hungry guests, it was particularly demoralising to then see said dishes be served to other guests, with no sign of ours making their way to the front of house. A further ten minutes pass, and we see more dishes begin to materialise, could it be ours? Thankfully yes, and the waiter began passing the food among our guests, great - the food is here, and our mood is lifted. Or is it?Now, let's cut to the chase. Three mains (including my own) were sent back to the kitchen, in all honesty - effectively inedible, a seabass main, a fish grill main, and a butterfly chicken main. I cannot say that I have ever had to vigorously chew a seabass fillet before, and I did not particularly enjoy doing so here. Along with these three plates of sorrow, two further dishes were returned to the kitchen, although this time to be actually cooked:As a specialist steak restaurant, we found it particularly gobsmacking, that two steak orders, one medium-rare and one medium-well, were practically still mooing on the plate. Upon return, whilst still not perfect the dishes were edible, though missing any of the sides they were sent back with until this was queried. The remaining guests reported good to average meals in fairness, though did comment that overcooking was a common theme, as was small portion sizes.The same two guests who ordered starters later (by later - this whilst the discussion was being had over what would make it to the bill, where we did have to check that the desserts actually still existed) received the 3rd course of their set - the pavlova, which again were very small though one would imagine this is why they are in the three-course-deal in the first place. As far as taste I believe there was no concern with these.As we near the end of this wonderous afternoon of wasted time and now for me at least, stomach grumbling hunger, it came time to pay the bill. Upon questioning the waitress as to the significant delays given our pre-booking, the rude delivery of the as ever pathetic excuse along the lines of  'we had a number of other guests to attend to' left a sour taste in my mouth - the only taste I had in my mouth I will reiterate.In all, a pre-booked lunch took the best part of 2-hours to suffer through, with inedible food, inattentive staff, and no apology in sight. The three returned dishes were removed from the bill and the remaining group settled up. So will I ever return here personally? No, I shall not, nor will I be shy about giving my thoughts on our visit whenever pertinent.I am certainly no expert in running a business, however can I perhaps suggest that if there is going to be a wait, you may wish to inform your guests of this, rather than hide from sight or fob them off, and if heaven forbid things do go poorly, you may wish to consider an apology as a way to soften the blow. Who knows, maybe this review wouldn't have taken as long as one of your meals in that case."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;value,"On way to theatre we thought we would stop off for a light bite. Caught the ‘before 6pm’ menu. Limited choice, great quality and at a very reasonable price. Service excellent; attentive yet unobtrusive. You can chose from 1,2 or three course options. If you have a large appetite this is not for you (the rest of the menu should satisfy you) but if you want something light but tasty then give it a go. "
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service;value,"I visited the Bloomsbury restaurant with my 8 year old son, I didn't know this was part of a chain.  We weren't offered a children's menu (I didn't know there was one) and ordered the 'special' for my son which was advertised on a board outside the restaurant with no price. With my (small and very unimpressive) spaghetti and tomato sauce, garlic bread (greasy and cold), the crab pasta special (with about a tablespoon of crab meat) and 2 drinks (one soft drink and one small beer) the bill came to £46!!.  The waiter didn't indicate the price of the special when he knew this was for my son (this was £22!), nor did he indicate that this was very spicy, so most of it was uneaten.  I made a very bad choice with this restaurant - there are 100s of other (independent restaurant) choices with better food and much more reasonable prices in London.  Very poor experience."

I should know, since my husband loves Italian food and we go so often to many different ones around the world! No sauce, when something is supposed to come with a creamy sauce, no flavour... Waste of money really. About the price, I guess that's normal to be so central in London, but still, very underwhelming."

Ik had voor dit etablissement gekozen omdat ik de ruimtes zo gezellig ingericht vond. Toen ik binnen kwam zat op de mooiste plek bij het raam een mevrouw achter een laptop die langdurig een zakelijk gesprek voerde. Zou voor mij een reden zijn om daar niet te willen koffie drinken of lunchen. Maar goed, we hadden hier afgesproken en één vd vriendinnen zat er al.Ik bestelde een koffie. Bij het afrekenen zag ik dat bij de kassa een certificaat hing waaruit bleek dat ze een award hadden gewonnen voor hun koffie. Ik vond de koffie niet bijzonder lekker: een beetje waterig met een te bittere smaak.Wat irritant was dat elke 5 minuten er een serveerster voor onze neus stond om te vragen wat we wilden.Bij het bestuderen van de menukaart schrok ik van de prijzen.Ik bestelde een broodje Brugse oude kaas met tomaten pesto, rucola, gekonfijte paprika & geroosterde pittenmix. Het brood smaakte verrukkelijk en de eerste hap Oude Brugse Kaas smaakte ook goed. Maar na drie happen vond ik de kaas veel te zout en de paprika erbij vond ik niet bijzonder lekker. En de rucola die op het geheel was gestort vond ik niets toevoegen. De koffie kostte dus € 2,95. En het broodje Oude Brugse kaas kostte € 7,75.

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience,"This place is a must when visiting Lisbon. They received Michelin Bib Gourmand sign meaning that you can have exceptionally good food at moderate price. This is for a good reason, no doubt about it!! Place is usually packed during peak hours but you have two options: either wait outside and order drinks from the window they have open, to have your time fly by more happily :) Option 2: Make a reservation earlier and go to explore beautiful city and come back when the time comes. We chose second option but drinks followed regardless :). The menu is simple, well described and not overwhelming with great selection of local wines and porto. We ordered:Marinated Olives: We loved their olives. This is always a good start to pair with wine.Octopus Salad: as an avid fans of octopus served in any dish we had to try their salad. It was delicious with noticeable hints of smoked paprika soaked in citrusy vinaigrette.Tuna Tartar: definitely one of the top ones we had eaten so far. Very fresh with radish, chives, avocado and wasabi eggs. This is an appetizer I could eat everyday.Prawns al Ajillo: the biggest ones they are serving. You pay for two pieces, simply grilled but served from heaven. We chose basmati rice side dish which was so buttery and flavorful making itself a perfect combination. Do not forget to squeeze the juice from the prawns heads, this is the best natural seafood sauce ever!!We had a bottle of our favorite Alvarinho to compliment our food. Overall the staff is very friendly and the place is very welcoming, packed with people who came to enjoy the Portugal culture, food, enjoyment. Tapisco will be in our memory for long time :)"

We had garlic bread for a starter which was just cheese on bread, no taste of garlic. The waiter never poured our drinks which I'm sure is one of the reasons they get a service charge. I wasnt even finished with my starter before the waitress started clearing our table for our mains. We both ordered meatballs... it literally tasted like sausages and beans out of a tin. We had a few mouthfuls and we asked for the bill, I told the waitress we didn't like the food and she just want and called the manager. The manager came over and told is twice he has never had a complaint... reading the reviews on here, will show you that's not true! He asked if we wanted something else 3 times before accepting no as our answer. They took the money for the starter and drinks without a word. It was clear to us that theu was annoyed we didn't like the food! Terrible service and bland food! "

Staff charming. No hassle at all. I then ordered off-piste: a veal scalopina, hold everything & I'll have a side of spinach. Delicious. No problem. My friend had maccarone and seafood. He loved it. We sat for another hour... a couple of carafes & a JD whiskey. Then profiteroles.  Absolutely charming. Lovely not to be at a regular chain. Water and requests kindly met. We spent nearly four hours catching up! Wonderful. Avoid the obvious chains. Quality food. Polite professional staff. Amenities super too."

tripadvisor,nld,-1,service;value;food,"Het restaurant ziet er leuk gestyled uit, bij binnenkomst waren er nog genoeg tafeltjes vrij. We moesten nog gaan zitten of er werd al gevraagd wat we wilden drinken. Eenmaal nadat we de kaart kregen werd er 2 minuten later weer gevraagd of we al wisten wat we wilden. Het leek wel of de bediening haast had ofzo.. We bestelden een drankje en vooraf nacho’s. De drankjes en de nacho’s kwamen a la minute naar ons tafeltje. De nacho’s waren warm, er zaten bechamelsaus, tomatensaus met gehakt en gefrituurde uitjes overheen. Bijzondere combi.Toen de pasta, wij namen beide de ‘dog’ maat, dit was echt een bord vol. Mijn pasta bevatte bijna hetzelfde als de nacho’s; bechamelsaus, tomatensaus met gehakt, gefrituurde uitjes, gebakken spekjes, parmezaanse kaas en ketchup. De spaghetti leek wel opgewarmd uit de magnetron, ik vond de pasta smakeloos en niet lekker. Het leek wel een bij elkaar geraapt zooitje. Na een paar happen was ik er al klaar mee. We moesten bijna €50 afrekenen voor iets waar we absoluut niet van genoten hebben. Eenmaal thuis ben ik nog gigantisch ziek geworden en is al het eten eruit gekomen. Deze zaak bezoek ik nooit meer."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service,"Had to ask twice and wait 20 minutes to take our order, and it wasn’t particularly busy. Was not helpful when it came to giving information about food on the menu, and when one of our dishes wasn’t correct, I had to wait 20 minutes for a new one so I didn’t receive it until my family was done eating. Also had to ask three times if we could get some tap water for the table, unfriendly staff in general. Just because your restaurant is in a central place and gets costumers anyways doesn’t mean you should treat your costumers like they are bothering you being there"

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;environment;food;service;reputation,"Whilst in Leicester on business a few of us went out for a meal. Middleton's was picked almost at random and what a great bit of luck it was too!The venue, an old bank, is superbly decorated - see photo.The menu is based on steak and is rather extensive with plenty of choice for both starters and main (the dessert menu is also pretty good!). As well as the main options there's plenty of variation available via sides etc.We had a bit of a wait for our food which given it was mostly empty is a bit of a worry on how they cope on a busy night (I assume they bring in more chefs/kitchen staff).One slight thing was we had to ask for finger bowls (a couple of us had whole prawns), these should come automatically as standard. But this is trivial...onto the food...Our food was lovely in both look and taste.It's not the cheapest at just under £30 for a drink, starter and main but given the quality still represents good value.The staff were friendly enough with just the right level of interaction. I'd happily return here and recommend it."

I had a pale ale served in the bottle which went well with the meal. Finished with chai tea which everyone enjoyed. We were not hurried out although we stayed long after we had finished eating.

I’m sure it was Beef but the jury is still out on that one .. Overall I’d NEVER come back the food is literally atrocious.. The service weak the ambiance to give out free head aches ..

Glasses and jugs for water came out stained and just looked dirty, ordered a drink that i found really strong so asked for it in a taller glass with some lemonade but the language barrier meant my glass was taken away and brought back exactly the same way. I had lasagne which was extremely dry and tasteless and my partner had gluten free pasta which came out under cooked. When we returned it we were condescendingly told that this is how pasta is served. I replied i knew what al dente was but this was just simply not cooked properly. Certainly wouldn't come back here.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"Both myself and my partner visited this restaurant for a pre show meal, we have both dined here before and never had an issue. However, on this visit there was most definitely a lack of speciality on this visit. Firstly, we were seated and then took a further 10 minutes even before we were given a menu. This normally is not an issue to us but were felt forgotten about already. We ordered drinks, an appletizer and a coke cola, the order was wrong as we were given 2 coke colas. For starter, I have the mozzarella balls with a tomato sauce, rather bland and the cheese was not melted. Either it was not cooked for long enough or it had been sitting on the hot plate for a little while. The mains came out and they were OK. My veal escalope was over cooked and the sauteed potatoes had a lot of oil with them. Overall, this visit gained 3/5 which is fair. Would we visit again? Yes we would, but most definitely wont be in a rush to get there."

The service was excelent, the place is elegant, the atmosphere was nice and best of all: the food was absolutely delicious! He had a Wellingtong Steak and I had a vegetarian option, starters, means, wine, dessert and cockteils, everything was absolutely amazing! And thanks very much for the surprise candle on the dessert! We loved it! Special mention to the waitress and the waiter, they were amazing! We defenitely will be back soon."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"After arriving and ordering our food our drinks and starters were ready immediately more or less, however our mains witch was only a steak sandwich and side salad and a burger and chips took nearly an hour they weren’t busy as we were second through door after it opened. After having to chase up where our food was it then arrived not very warm. My son is 1 and his burger still had a heart beat.i refused to pay for this and because of how long we waited and how rubbish it actually was the manager very good of him did not charge us at all for our food only drinks. Was having quality time with a dear friend and I feel our meal let our day down massively. Probably just a one off today but I don’t think I will be going back again."

The menu is fun with beer matched to the burgers. The burger was not bad but not great either and definitely not a premium version of burgers. In fact, the sauces are nice, the beef less so. The chips tasted bland. Overall, expensive for the quality and service.  "
tripadvisor,eng,1,food;reputation;environment;convenience,"We went here on our last night in Lisbon and were very pleased with the experience. The restaurant felt very authentic and had such a nice vibe. Even though they were busy, the service was fast and we didn’t have to wait long for our food. I had the vegetarian spring rolls for starters and then Malaysian yellow curry with sticky rice. It was so delicious! If you are coming at dinner time, prepare to queue for a while because they don’t take reservations. You will most likely have to wait outside for a little while but it’s worth the wait! We were lucky and only had to wait for a few minutes, but if you arrive with a bigger group, come early. "
tripadvisor,eng,1,food;service,"This quirky restaurant was just across the road from our hotel and while we generally ate traditional German food during our stay in Dusseldorf, we decided to try this place one night before heading to the old town, thinking it would be typical fast food. Well the service was fast, and we were promised the freshest burger we had ever eaten when placing our order. I'm not sure it was quite that, but it was a really nice burger  and the portion sizes are huge! We all had the Killer burger and it literally did kill us, so much so we never made it to the old town that night as we were so full! Now I am big eater so it takes quite a lot to finish me off! If you have plans for the evening then I highly recommend going for something a little lighter than the killer! We ordered it as part of the Killer combo deal and I asked for a side of chips with chilli and cheese, this was fantastic even though I didn't manage to eat it all. The lemonade which came as part of the combo was really delicious! We couldn't have possibly tried one of the shakes, that really would have finished us off, but they looked amazing! I think this place is worth checking out if your passing or staying nearby, there was also a What's Pizza a few doors down which we never had chance to check out during this stay. Next time!"
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;reputation;food,"Went with great expectations, which were not met. This was a Birthday treat for my Husband, at least he got a decent meal, I did NOT!All was going well, starters of grilled Halloumi & veg skewers were delicious. My Husband's main, grilled Salmon, Prawns, Calamari, Sea Bass, he said was delicious. I had ordered a half of Lobster, with garlic butter & requested that it was not served with anything else, but that I wanted the Macaroni Cheese as well. When it arrived, the half a lobster was served with accompaniments as per the menu. When I pointed this out to the waiter, he said ""Just to leave it, I wasn't paying extra for it!"" NOT happy, I requested it to be removed. THEN I realised that instead of the Macaroni Cheese that I had ordered from the main menu,it  was presented as a side order. Not only had they got that wrong, when I started to eat it, it was just plain macaroni with breadcrumbs on top. When I called the waitress she stood looking at it, saying,oh that's funny, where's the sauce? That's what I wanted to know? She did offer to replace it with the correct order but that would have meant my lobster getting cold whilst I waited, I went for the offer of a portion of the cheese sauce instead. You couldn't make it up, the 'Cheese sauce that was on the Macaroni Cheese menu was  'Blue cheese & Cheddar ' I was given warmed up cheese salad dressing! Oh, I haven't mentioned the Lobster have I. This was watery & tasteless, I would say this was a frozen product & not a fresh Lobster. We will NOT return & will NOT recommend it. It takes a lot to make me give such a harsh review, but Middleton's you EARNED IT!"

The server who showed us to our table was pleasant and helpful. It got a little busier as the evening went on as I guess lots of people had the same idea.The young lady who took over after we were seated was not particularly helpful and we had to ask (twice) for the pre theatre menu and the set menu, as this wasn’t offered to us, even though it was advertised on the website. This young lady was unable to answer any questions regarding the menus or the dishes and also kept forgetting to bring other things out which we’d asked for, causing us to have to ask several times for the same thing as we were conscious that we were on a time limit due to the show we’d booked to see. I wouldn’t say the food was amazing, it was edible, warm, but just ok. Although I must say that the pizzas which other customers had ordered looked lovely.I would visit again if I was visiting the theatre there, however I’d allow a bit more time and would know what to expect.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;reputation;value,"I had booked a table for five people for lunch on Saturday 13 July.  When we arrived, our reserved table was a table for four with an extra chair at the end of one of the tables.  That was ridiculous for five people as there simply wouldn't have been room for the fifth plate so we asked for a different table which, as the restaurant wasn't busy, wasn't an issue luckily.The waitress then wanted to take our order a matter of minutes after we'd been seated and given the menus - we were still reading the menu so asked her to come back.  Of course, when we had all chosen what we wanted, we couldn't find anyone to take the order!!We ordered a couple of starters to share between the table - crescentine and pane all aglio - both were fine, if a little greasy.For the main courses we ordered 2 x maccheroni pesto rosso, 1 tortelloni di asparagi, 1 x linguine alle vongole and 1 lasagne pasticciate - all were fine, nothing special.For dessert we ordered 1 pizza nutella to share between two, 1 tiramisu, 1 affogato and 1 caffe goloso with the chocolate brownie - this was probably the best course.What we were really annoyed about - but didn't know until the bill was presented - was that we had ordered a bottle of house wine and were told house wine only came in a carafe which we were then charged £26.95 for.  When I looked on the website afterwards, it clearly states that the bottle of house wine costs £11.90 - we were ripped off to the tune of £15.05 which is completely disgraceful.Obviously the staff are trained to up-sell on the drinks but it is completely dishonest to tell them to tell the customer that the only option for house wine is a carafe (which we weren't told the cost of and would never have guessed it would have been anywhere near the £26.95 charge) when a bottle of house wine is actually £11.90.A 12.5% service charge was also added - this amounted to £15.48 - the service wasn't good and possibly the reason why is because the servers know they're going to get the tips anyway.So, our bill came to £139.28 - this did not represent good value for what we received and, as previously stated, because we were totally ripped off with the wine, it's left a very bad taste in our mouth."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,service,"Extremely rude, impolite and aggressive female waiter - manager of the restaurant - Karina CoraiBaca which effectively harassed us to the limit. For some context and better understanding, the restaurant is located in Place Jourdan best known in Brussels for its Maison Antoine located the middle of the square which is one of the 2 oldest friteries priding with the best you can eat Belgian fries. There is an unwritten rule that you can serve the fries on all the terraces while ordering beer or something from the restaurants. This being said, we were 2 persons, I went to buy the fries (there are very long waiting ques usually) and my companion took a seat on the terrace of Ellis to order burgers and some drinks - important to mention that we talk about the terrace located in the middle of the square, across the road and not the terrace located on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Upon my return, drinks were already served and in less than 5 minutes a server brings the burgers. Seeing that we had the fries from Maison Antoine, he kindly informs us of the policy of Ellis that they don't allow their customers to buy and consume fries from somewhere else but as the burgers are served he is kind enough to make a joke and agrees to make an exception this time. Less than 5 minutes and the manager arrives informing us she is in charge and despite having the approval of her colleague waiter, we have to pack our fries in order to continue eating. Needless to say we were both enjoying the burgers up to that moment which lasted for another 5 minutes of intense debate during which we acknowledged the strict policy of the restaurant but as we were not informed before ordering, we asked to be left to finish our dinner in peace. Finally after several times asking, the lady visibly irritated by the fact that we did not agree to leave or pack our fries stormed out saying we'll pay a supplement. Of course our appetite was dead and asked for the check immediately. Having to pay inside by the counter (rule of the restaurant) I had to deal with the manager again as she tried to force me pay an extra amount of 3 Euros because not ordering fries from them with the threat that she will call the police if I don't agree. Furthermore, we were both called liars several times just because we did not order fries from the restaurant and were informed that we are no longer welcome there. Thanks a lot Ellis Gourmet Burger for the nice treatment of your customers, it was indeed one different and never to forget experience."

tripadvisor,nld,-1,environment,"Het was al lange tijd geleden dat we er nog geweest waren en wat. een. verschil. Ik vond de hele werking niet professioneel. Degene die bijna moesten beginnen te werken hingen aan de bar te kletsen met degene die wel al begonnen waren aan hun shift. De bediening was gewoon joviaal. Ik besliste om een raspberry daiqiuri te bestellen als apéro. Voor €10 had ik een smaakvolle cocktail verwacht maar helaas was het pure rum met een vleugje limoensmaak. Framboos? Niet gezien noch geproefd. Daarnaast was de drank nogal warm, ondanks de ijsblokken. Toen we de bediening erover aanspraken dat de cocktail te straf was kregen we wat spuitwater om erbij te gieten. Het doet niets aan de reeds fletse smaak, maar bon. Mijn partner heeft de Meatlover burger gekozen, voor €15,5. Hij vond er weinig speciaal aan maar ook niet slecht. Ikzelf heb de classic genomen, gewoon goed. We vonden de algemene ervaring niet van die mate dat we nog snel zouden terugkeren. We vonden het er ook vrij ‘vuil’ aangezien we de eerste klanten waren van die dag: Vliegenstronten op de vensterbank, stofnetten rond de radiator. Spijtig. Want we zijn tig keren naar Ellis gaan eten in verschillende steden en waren anders altijd tevreden."

Es liegt ziemlich zentral, aber an einer eher ruhigen Straße. Das Personal ist wirklich sehr freundlich und erklärt direkt am Empfang, wie der Laden funktioniert. Es gibt mehrere Sorten von ""Bällchen"", mit Schwein, Huhn oder vegetarisch (allerdings nicht vegan), und dazu kann man dann die Beilage (Salat oder Kartoffel-/Gemüsestampf) wählen. Die Klopse sind ganz interessant aufgebaut - es gibt einen ""Kern"" (z.B. Trüffelsauce, Tomate-Aubergine etc.), um diesen Kern ist dann der Ball aus Hack oder Reis, und dann wird der ganze Ball nochmal paniert und im Ofen gebacken. Insgesamt ist es ein ungewöhnliches Geschmackserlebnis, und so ein Ball macht dann auch wirklich satt.Die Preise sind für belgische Verhältnisse angemessen, außerdem gibt es Wasser und Äpfel zum Nachtisch umsonst. Insgesamt ein sehr schönes und empfehlenswertes Erlebnis."

Es gibt mindestens vier unterschiedliche Burger, die auch wirklich unterschiedlich schmecken - sowohl die Saucen als auch die ""Frikadellen"" unterscheiden sich.

It's nicely served on the design side but not really a single touch of cooking, except maybe cutting oignon and cumcumber. We had half a chicken and tacos with grated chicken: I wonder how was my chicken grated as I has pieces instead. The sauce was of course industrial as was the salad dressing which was awful. The taste of the chicken is ...the taste of a mid-range chicken, really nothing exceptional. If you cook an organic chicken at home or a chicken that has the 'Label Rouge' (80 days breeding minimum), you definitely have a better taste.The supposedly potatoes cooked in the oven were not: they were boiled and then put in a pan to fry a bit. I mean, if you cook at home you cannot miss these details. The crunch of a potato in the oven was completely absent. Idem for the chicken seasoning/broth: if you do it at home yourself, you know how it tastes.Fries: they were also uninteresting: ok they have a special design and it's nice for the eye and....that's it: they were not crunchy at all, felt really industrial and had for some of them (enough to be noticed) potato black eyes. When you think the almost most famous frit-kot of Brussels is around the corner, the comparison doesn't resist.So in the end, the place feeds you with a certain price, you probably won't get sick, they serve quite swiftly, so if this is was you're looking for, go. For the rest, it unfortuanely felt like a good old marketing product surfing on a poshy placement on the market. Other places on the square are cheaper or equivalent in price and tastier."

tripadvisor,nld,-1,value,Hebben hier gegeten met vrienden. Ikzelf heb vol au vent gegeten. Zeer lekker. De rest van het gezelschap had de kip met appelmoes en kroketjes. Niet speciaal eigenlijk. En duur voor een stukje gebraden kip. Ook spijtig dat je kroketjes en frietjes moet bijbetalen. Maak toch 1 prijs met frietjes en kroketten inbegrepen. Waren nog aan het aperitieven toen het eten al kwam. Niet slecht maar geen WoW!
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food,"My wife and I decided to have a treat on Friday evening and thought to visit The Steakhouse in Middleton. We had not been for a while and didn't book, hoping we could enjoy a couple of hours having a meal.We were welcomed at the door and asked if we could have a table, they seemed very busy but were immediately shown to a table for two and made very welcome.Our waitress Jess soon took our order, got a bottle of wine delivered to our table and we enjoyed a starter before our main course, fillet steak, cooked to perfection, with assorted vegetables of our choice and finished with home made sweets for us both.We enquired from Jess who had cooked our meal, she informed us ayoung man called Romeo and we were delighted with the food presented and the very attentive service throughout. We are both delighted to recommend this Great Restaurant, food and service ""Perfect""Elaine and Roger Williams South Wootton"
tripadvisor,nld,-1,service,Als we binnen kwamen moesten we eerst 1 u wachten om überhaupt te bestellen. Dan eindelijk konden bestellen. Raad eens hoelang we moesten wachten. Nog 1U !!!Eindelijk onze burgers gekregen. We hadden ook nog frieten besteld waar we extra voor moesten betalen. Die waren 20 min na de burgers. Nooit meer naar ellis burgers!!

tripadvisor,fra,-1,service,"Le restaurant est d’apparence très agréable, mais une fois à table on comprend que la devanture ne veut pas tout dire. Les serveurs ne regardent jamais et parlent entre eux, après avoir fait des signes l’un d’entre eux se décide enfin à venir.Nous avons commandé du calamar en entrée puis 2 hamburgers, après 40 minutes d’attente nos hamburgers arrivent enfin. Mais toujours pas les calamars qui arrivent au beau milieu du repas, et pour montrer qu’il n’ont aucune organisation, ils nous on a nouveau ramené du calamar à la fin du repas... Dégoûté."
tripadvisor,fra,-1,service,"Par où commencer... ? - L’attente : au moins une bonne quarantaine de minutes. Nous avions commandé des calamars en entrée, ils sont arrivés au milieu du repas.- L’organisation : à revoir de toute urgence !! Les calamars nous été servis deux fois (une fois au milieu et une fois à la fin). - Les serveurs : complètement à l’ouest (je n’ai pourtant pas vu de coffe shop à côté...). Le plat de calamar servi en trop à alors été dégusté par leurs soins bien qu’il était en réalité destiné à la table d’a côté (qui attendait depuis longtemps aussi). - La propreté : dommage que nous sommes pas rentrés directement dedans, nous serions vite partis.

For the adults, the menu was varied enough and had lots of standards, such as pastas with Bolognese, or Arabiatta sauces. So good for vegetarians too.Prices were a little high for what you were getting but staff were friendly and offered a complimentary glass of limoncello at the end of the meal....a nice touch."

We both opted for a brunch item, choosing Eggs Benedict (regular with ham for me and the vegetable version for her).  Both were cooked perfectly wanting for maybe a bit more Hollandaise sauce but extremely tasty.  The service was excellent and the price reasonable.  I had both a Latte and a Cappuccino - both excellent.  Definitely will recommend it to anyone looking for a quick meal."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,food,The business is doing their best to make a concept and draw costumers. But the lack of good management/staff who guard the quality of the food makes costumers leave with a mixed feeling. The meatlovers burger had a messy brown sauce on the meat that should have been pulled pork but looked liked a chiwawa took a dump in my burger. Not what you expect for 15€.

tripadvisor,nld,-1,food;service,Absolute tegenvaller... Al voor de tweede keer! Ik bestelde de  huis aperitief op basis van cava en 'verse' ice tea. Wat kreeg ik: cava + kriek. Schandalig! Alle beef burgers waren lauw en de kippenburgers waren koud en niet doorbakken. Burgers teruggestuurd maar wouden absoluut geen nieuwe meer. Totale chaos op het terras. Personeel wist niet wat eerst doen en bovendien geen leiding. Jammer dat dit concept kwantiteit boven kwaliteit zet. Men kan hier zoveel meer uithalen mits goede begeleiding.

The starters were ok, pate was served with 3 v small pieces of unattractive dry bread. That with the marmalade was it - no frills and no salad. Wings were good as was the deep fried cheese.Two of us ordered lamb steak and one had ribs the other chicken. Yes they like steak but didn’t have it !!!!!! The lamb was v good and so was the ribs , chicken not so.Again, presented in a boring way, v small portions of peas and chips.We had one dessert, sticky toffee which was ok.The service was good and we were reasonably happy with the night out.They do need to get the cleaners in though , masses of dust on the surfaces around the table."

Ik nam de Bollywood burger, de burger van het moment, met kip, mangochutney, lichte curry denk ik. Heel lekkere combinatie. Er zijn massa’s plaatsen waar je een burger kan eten, maar Ellis vind ik toch de beste op het vlak van kwaliteit en creativiteit. Burgers met vlees maar ook vis of veggie. En daarnaast lekkere home made lemonades en draft beer. In plaats van de gewone frieten nam ik de zoete aardappel met tartaar, was ook lekker. Prima plek voor een lekkere maaltijd op een mooi plekje!

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,I chose this restaurant as it was opposite the theatre where I was taking my husband for his birthday. We waited at least 10 minutes before the waiter came over to take our drinks order. Unfortunately on a very hot day both beer and wine were warm. We ordered spaghetti carbonara but it was dry as a bone. There was literally no sauce whatsoever. I noticed the lady next to me had the same thing and she had left hers too. I have problems swallowing after cancer treatment so I couldn’t eat it. My husband ordered another beer but it never arrived - although it did appear on the bill!  Will never come back!
tripadvisor,fra,-1,service;environment;food,"Que dire?Nous avons déjà attendu 25 minutes avant que l'un serveur ne nous apporte les cartes. Celles-ci, sont plutôt mal fichues puisque très longues (espèces de livres avec 3 burgers par pages et je ne sais combien d'espèces de burgers différents) Autant vous dire que lorsqu'on arrive à la fin du menu, on a déjà oublié tous les burgers qui étaient avant. De nouveau, très longue attente avant la prise de la commande. Étant en plein soleil, sous 32°, sans parasol,  nous demandons pour pouvoir être déplacés à l'intérieur.  Fort gentiment (raison de mon unique étoile),  le serveur accepte et nous place près de la fenêtre. Mais là,  horreur,  l'intérieur du restaurant -non climatisé- est infesté de mouches. On nous apporte nos burgers qui, de toute évidence ont été cuits, re-cuits et re-re-cuits. D'ailleurs,  ce n'est pas étonnant puisque le serveur ne nous a pas demandé quelle type de cuisson nous désirions. Parmi nous, une personne allergique aux tomates avait demandé que son burger n'en contienne pas en contient, bien évidement.Les mini-burgers des enfants,durs comme du bois, sont dans des pains secs et trop cuits.Et pour les menus adultes, les frites sont en supplément. Seul petit point positif, la petite salade de chou et de pommes qui accompagne tous les burgers.Le tout pour une addition de 109€ pour 4 adultes et 2 enfants. Bref, je ne peux que vous déconseiller d'y aller."

tripadvisor,eng,1,food;reputation,"We ate as a couple of friends here tonight on the second night of a five night stay in beautiful Lisbon. On the advice of our hotel, we went early to avoid disappointment arriving at just before eight and were lucky to get the very final two seats available - at the bar overlooking the open kitchen: rather than mind this, it made for a great show whilst waiting between courses. We went for a fairly typical Thai meal sharing three starters, a couple of mains, cocktails and a few sides and it was all absolutely perfect. I’ve eaten Thai food in Thailand and this is the genuine stuff. I note they also have Indian, Japanese and Vietnamese elements to their menu and I don’t doubt these are just as good. But the Thai was exceptional. Long may this place prosper and if you’re in the city for a short time or otherwise, go. "

I love how tap water is provided in bottles without having to ask for it. The food and service was excellent - Marta our waitress was very attentive and couldn't do enough for us.My only gripe would be that the pate never comes with enough bread!

Ordered a linguini gamberi which was very watery and bordering on tasteless. It took forever for water carafe to be refilled, and for bill to arrive. Ok, so maybe the abnormally hot UK day caused a staff shortage, but the Manager could limit patrons to a number that is manageable. "
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;convenience;food,"We were happy to find some free outside sitting on a Friday afternoon in the middle of the city. We ordered mains and desserts. One of us were vegetarian, and this is the first missing detail. On the menu it wasn't indicated which dishes are suitable for vegetarians, so we had to help pick out all the dishes for her. The food was delicious and the portion size was nice as well, no questions here. We ordered a type of sea food pasta as well, which was nice. But I was missing the lemon, and also we were missing the salt and pepper shakers from out table. I get the idea that, yes the restaurant is on a busy street, and those shakers can walk away easily, but at least offer for people how are sitting outside. Also, we didn't get any nibbs(paprika corns), which were clearly put on the tables inside of the restaurant, but we needed to ask for one when we saw it.Nevertheless the food was delicious, the desserts were amazing (go for that brownie) and our waiter came back several time to ask if we need something and everything was fine. Just those small details were a bit annoying. "

I have been about 10 times, as groups, family, business meetings and always found it excellent. The seafood is well-worth trying and varied.  The vegetarian/vegan options are very tasty, so our fellow diners who tried it tell me.  A small but very high-quality wine list.  Peasant ambience and extremely good service. Good mixture of clients and types. I have enjoyed my experiences there in several circumstances, but is a perhaps a very commendable place for family meals and occasions. Not over-priced either."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,service,"Ellis’ burgers are still as good as ever but the quality of the service has nosedived.The restaurant is understaffed - possibly with the opening of the new terrace on place Jourdan - and the staff seem to be stressed. The duty manager “responsable de service” was pretty unpleasant, to us and to new staff who were struggling and getting little guidance from her.I pointed out to the duty manager that there was no soap in the loos and she said she was aware of that but there was nothing she could do. When I suggested she ask someone to run across to Carrefour to pick up some soap, she said that wasn’t possible and that it would be arriving in a delivery the next day. I have been a regular of Ellis gourmet burger since it opened on Place Jourdan. Service has generally been pretty good. That is no longer the case."

Als hoofdgerecht de Ellis 2.0 special burger en die waren zeer mals en sappig. Echt aan te raden. De frites lekker doorgebakken en de coleslaw was lekker fris. Maar de cheese cake....  wauw, waanzinnig super-duper lekker. Mooi zacht van smaak, met heerlijke brokjes chocolade en frambozenparels. 🔝Prijs, kwaliteit, vriendelijke service, entourage en snelheid bediening was allemaal uitstekend.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,food;service,"My family and I have been to the Maasmechelen  Ellis burger many times. In fact sometimes we go there just for the burger, not the shopping. Today we had a terrible experience and wen possibly wont go back. It started with a rude reception. Then my wife ordered white wine and literally got a 1/4 glass of wine. When she asked the waiter to top it up he was rude and said that’s just the way it is. Then we got our burgers. They are smaller than usual. Much. When we questioned the manager he said Apparently head office is clamping down on costs and the burgers are now only 100 grams. Ridiculously small compared to what they used to be. I had the Ellis burger as usual but it was absolutely tasteless. The fries tasted Like they’d been baked for 5 days. Not a great experience - either service or good wise. I think they’ve lost a customer in us. "

I was able to add an extra person to our party at late notice, a friend was late and they accomodated this despite our large party. The food came promptly and the steak was cooked perfectly. Pricey but definitely worth it."

The bartenders are fun to watch and the drinks were very good.  Be aware this is note a quiet or romantic place but the atmosphere is fun and welcoming and the staff is great.We ordered the peking duck rolls, prawn toast, Japanese beef sweet potato noodles and pork belly bao. They were all wonderful and every item that passed by our table, I wanted to order as well.  It all looked good.Our noodle dish was initially forgotten about and we had about 4 people come over to check on us when we said we were still waiting - the customer service was great. I would love to have a restaurant like this closer - the vibe and food were outstanding and it was lovely for a change of pace after so many charcuterie plates!"

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service;environment,"I'd heard that Mddletons do amazing steaks, so took husband there. He said it was the best steak he's had in ages...and it looked beautifully cooked (medium rare). I had seafood mixed grill which was also really well cooked and delicious. The desserts were a-maz-ing! Baileys cheesecake and sticky toffee pud were just fabulous. Drinks are reasonaly priced. Staff are all friendly and attentive (but not over the top). It was crazy busy on a Saturday night, but the atmosphere was really chilled. My only gripe...being a bit of an eco-warrior...is...that they are still using plastic straws in their cocktails. Not cool! Otherwise, a great find. Definitely going back there...maybe with the teens kids on a Sunday."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"We visited for my grandsons 18th birthday.  Unfortunately, we were asked to pre-order which meant some steaks arrived dry and only luke warm.  My husbands was stone cold he told the Waitress  whose reply was do you want it taken away.  Not quite the response you would expect.  My husbands mushroom was the smallest I have ever seen and mine was completely cold and my Diane sauce was so thick I scraped it out of the dish.   My desert did not arrive and there was no one to mention it to and as the cake was brought out. I said remove it from bill. When it came it had not been taken off.  We had a lovely family evening but felt some food and service could have been better.  I definitely would not pre-order if visiting again."

Revenons au poule! Je suis né dans un magasin de volaille gibier sur Etterbeek, à une époque ou le poulet rôti était un must have le dimanche midi en famille ! Nous étions réputés pour répondre à cette demande chaque dimanche et bien entendu les autres jours de la semaine, nos volailles étaient de qualité fermière et encore plumées à la main, autant vous dire que vous ne trouvez plus cela aujourd’hui ou alors difficilement ! Et bien ici dans ce resto j’ai retrouvé une excellente qualité de volailles, je ne connais pas les origines de leurs poulets, mais le goût et la texture sont très satisfaisant.

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,"From as soon as we entered until we left we felt very relaxed and happy. We had a very rare date night for me and my hubby here and boy did he choose well! We were seated in a booth,next to the kitchen, nice and cosy. Away from other tables so we could hear eachother clearly, yet close enough to the atmosphere to hear the music and happy chatter. Our starters were amazing, we ordered the ham and leak croquettes and the king prawns. Unfortunately for me, I had a reaction to the prawns and came out in a rash, but that's my own fault as I assume they cooked them where the lobster is cooked and I have an allergy (completely forgot to say!) However, this wasn't an issue at all as it tasted amazing! Main course was even better. Whenever me and my husband go out we find it really hard to settle on dishes, so instead we ordered 2 dishes and shared so that way we could taste more.He ordered a platter and I ordered a beef wellington (which can I just say was oh. My. Stop talking good.) Between us we had the wellington, lamb steak (our favourite- simply delicious), Piri Piri chicken (also..need to add this... So very moist and tasted beautiful, like a delicate flavour), steak (again, saliva filling mouth thinking of it), BBQ ribs- the meat basically fell off the bone! And then sides of onion rings and sweet potato fries. Compliments, and I mean there were several orgasmic compliments, to the chef's!! Thankyou to them for making me realise that my cooking, in actual fact, sucks.Pudding was a bit of a give or take here. To be honest, we could have just left without it- probably should have too, working my food baby.The coffee was delicious though that came alongside pudding.We will definitely be coming back here. And probably be bringing my lovely in laws, one of which has caeliac disease, so will be in heaven when she sees what is to offer! Thankyou again for giving my taste buds the best one night stand they have ever had!"

Binnen stonden tientallen lege kratten en dat maakte het rommelig.Dat gezegd hebbende: De burgers waren erg lekker! Goede smaak, goed bereid en goede saus. De friet was vrij matig. Het restaurant zelf ziet er wel gezellig uit.Dit was onze eerste avond in Brugge en we vonden de prijzen wat hoog voor wat we kregen, maar dat blijkt overal in de stad toch wat duurder te zijn dan ik gewend was.Als je voor een lekkere burger met bijpassend biertje gaat, kun je hier prima eten!

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;food;value,"Went to the Spaghetti House, Cranbourn Street on one of those hot evenings we had in July. Managed to get a table inside downstairs where they had air-con, so that was good - but probably the only good thing about the visit. Asked for a jug of tap-water which came immediately but had obviously been standing around somewhere as the water was warm. Had a 50cl carafe of the Pinot Grigio - again, not very chilled and not a very nice wine.Food- wise we had one pizza which was ok but nothing special, and one portion of lasagne. Both came out surprisingly quickly but the lasagne was a disgrace to the dish. A VERY SMALL portion of something that was pretty dried out - obviously been standing around a while and a real rip-off at £12.95 - and you get nothing with it.A very disappointing visit and a shame as I always though that the 'Spaghetti House' chain had a good reputation."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service;value,"Some friends and I stopped by here recently for a bite to eat before a night out. I didn't have high hopes because the quality of high street Italian chain restaurants is usually not good. However, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with my first two courses. My fried calamari starter was tasty and I have to say the spaghetti and meatballs I ordered for my main was really good - al dente spaghetti, good consistency sauce and hearty meatballs. Unfortunately, dessert was a big let-down because what was advertised as an apple tart didn't seem to have any hint of apples in it. Another let-down was the service. We were a group of four but my brother's starter didn't turn up until 20 minutes after the rest of us had been served and finished our starters, and this was only because we'd reminded the waiter it was missing - I'm convinced he'd forgotten about it and it wouldn't have arrived at all if we hadn't said something. It all also took an age for the bill to be brought to us, even though we'd asked for it twice. And whilst we're on the topic of money, I have to say I think this place is rather pricey for what you actually get.Because of the disappointing dessert and forgetful service I can't give this restaurant a higher score than average. My advice to readers would be to stick to a starter and a main only, and don't come here if you need to be somewhere afterwards in a hurry."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"Visited last Sunday evening, party of four plus my seven-year old granddaughter. Not busy, with the number of other parties in the dining room just about covering off the fingers on one hand. Apart from the ladies in the hen group we thought we'd crashed a well attended meeting of those who'd voted for a certain former Peterborough MP in the recent by-election.I should say that my daughters' steaks were fine as was the bottle of Voignier (at twenty two quid), which for me was the high point of the visit. That's where the good bits end. Not being a fan of steak, after being advised that what I'd ordered first off had run out I settled for something else that looked interesting - the mushroon wellington from the veggie section of the menu. I was slightly bemused when I was asked how I'd like it cooked (well done etc). My wife ordered a spicy chicken dish. When the food finally got to the table I received what looked to be an imitation of a Greggs vegetable pasty and my wife's chicken was simply ""painted"". If you choose to forego the skin (as many do) what you're left with is, well, a piece of plain grilled chicken - no attempt made to score or marinade it although I can guess the reason for that. I suspect my ""wellington"" came out of a box delivered by a 3663 driver, Brake Bros, or whoever Middleton's use and went straight into the oven.After one of the kitchen staff had attempted to bend one in, and simply re-plated something that went back rather than replace it as I was promised (the bite I'd taken out of it was a bit of a clue), the  replacement arrived at about the same time as everyone else had finished. One of my daughters called for the desert menu and popped off to the ladies. When she returned a few minutes later, I asked her what she was going to order and she said ""I'm not going to bother. I don't think we should give this place any more of our money than we have to"". So apart from the little'un deserts were binned and my wife called for the bill.The DM removed the price of my main and knocked another tenner off for the impromptu rendition of Fawlty Towers. Despite this, the bill still clocked in at over a hundred quid and I could see my wife grimace as she handed over her credit card. She said later she resented having to pay every penny - which is no surprise bearing in mind the bill represents a week's earnings for her in her part-time job.Hey ho, lessons learned. One of the waiting staff did apologise profusely for the delays and the kitchen sending something back out that should have gone in the bin. I've never heard a waitress/waiter use the terms ""I'm taking ownership of this problem"" and ""representative of the company"" before on a dining floor, and I suspect both of these phrases can be found in the induction training manual for serving staff somewhere. I'm sure she was sincere, but regrettably such BS management phrases are usually lost on me (as I have to suffer many of them on a daily basis at work) and it just moved my patience gauge slightly further into the red. A simple ""sorry, we screw up sometimes"" would have sufficed.Yet another chain restaurant I think we'll be avoiding in the future. Sorry guys."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;food,I visited here on a date night and it took over an hour to have our starter and main served for two of us.  The restaurant was moderately busy but nothing exceptional.  Our waitress was lovely though and I tipped her as she said if it was cash she would get it (on us asking)- the reason it as slow was she was helping the others out so not her fault at all.
tripadvisor,eng,-1,food;experience;service,We were welcomed and quickly seated near the entrance which was nice as it was a hot day. The service was a little slow and the waiter was quite abrupt. Four out of the five meals arrived and were well presented and were lovely. The ceaser salad was delicious. My main concern about this restaurant was the attitude towards one of our parties food allergies. She ordered a salad that had goats cheese on it but asked to have it without the cheese as she is not able to eat dairy. The waiter bought the dish with the goats cheese and when it was pointed out it had been ordered without his response was - ‘it is not much it won’t hurt you!’ We thought he was joking and were quite shocked to find that he wasn’t!! In this day and age and with all the information available about allergies we were quite shocked. We eventually persuaded him to take it back and make another but it took so long she ended up eating on her own. Be careful if you visit and have a food allergy the food is good but it could be risky!!

tripadvisor,eng,1,food;value;service,"To start with the good things: the food is great and the price is very reasonable too.What is not great is the service model. It is self service, meaning you need to wait in line for your food. In our case we had to stand and wait for 45 minutes. Also they work with a card system to pay on the way out. At least that is all they said when introducing the system. Turns out there is some kind of limit per card(still don't know what the limit is, but must be below 50 euro as I spent 52 euro for 4 people). They introduced this limit when it was finally time to ok order after 45 minutes wait and initially they wanted me to go back and get another card and wait again. Which I refused of course as they introduced new rules during the game. Finally the cook also realized how unreasonable this was and solved the problem after 5 minutes additional delay.Conclusion the food is great, just the very inefficient not customer oriented service model ruined it all. Not recommended when there are people in the waiting line."
tripadvisor,eng,0,service;food,"We were sat by the windows in the restaurant which was an area that was already quite full, I'm guessing this makes it easier for the staff but it's nicer for the customer if they're a bit more spaced out. There was a lot of space in the restaurant near where you come in so would have been better to be offered the choice to sit there. We were given a menu and then waited quite some time before our order was taken and that was only because I asked the waitress if we were supposed to go up and order because it had been so long. Our food didn't take too long to come after that, we ordered a burger which was very good, sweet potato fries which were pretty standard and onion ring that were also pretty standard. We also ordered the chicken wings which were good and came with a nice sauce. You pay at the till as you leave so don't sit around waiting for them to get you your bill. The food is good, the service is slow and the staff look like they can't be bothered, but if you're not in a rush and fancy a good burger then it's worth a visit."

As we were a big group I played the organizer to help. I asked her about the types of beers and her answer was... they are on the menu! in a very arrogant way, without even looking at me. Then when they brought the meals, she was not well understood which was each one so we asked what brings each as they were all similar but with different sauces and that bothered them. They gave us one wrong dish and we didn't even complain it. I asked her for an extra drink and she didn't even bring it until at the end I had to stop to tell her ! I asked you for a drink 10 minutes ago. Finally to pay the bill we asked her if we could pay separately, she answered again in a very disrespectful way! No!  5 minutes after the bill did not arrive we asked her again for the bill and she said! again rude, is there! Indicating the cash register and left!

Het duurde een poos voor de gerechten opgediend werden. Pas bij het opdienen vertelde de ober dat er geen rozemarijnaardappelen waren. Mijn vriendin vroeg een portie kroketten in de plaats. Die is uiteindelijk nooit geleverd. Toen we iemand van het personeel daarop attendeerden, volgden er ook geen excuses of compensatie, louter de melding ""dat zij daar niets aan kon veranderen"" en ""dat ze de niet geleverde portie kroketten niet zou aanrekenen"". Nou!Voor louter het (lekkere) kleine plakje crispy fried chicken heeft mijn vriendin €9,50 moeten betalen. Heel veel geld voor louter een klein stuk vlees. Mijn portie kroketten kostte trouwens €3,50. Voor dat geld krijg je 5 kroketten. Erg pover.De zaak is mooi ingericht en het eten is lekker, maar de bediening verloopt wanordelijk en de porties zijn gewoon veel te klein om de prijs te rechtvaardigen.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service;reputation,I had lunch with my wife following a hospital visit. We were hassled to order but waited ages for food. They were not busy but we noticed that people coming in before us were served well before us and we had only ordered a burger and a pizza! We attracted the waiter and he said two minutes. My wife said that  the burger was quite ordinary and my pizza was the worst that I have had in a restaurant. Very leathery on a cold plate and I only ate half of it. Waiter asked if everything was OK and I told him it was very disappointing. Unusually for me I refused to pay the 12.5% service charge. I cannot recommend this restaurant and will not go there again.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;food,My mum frequents this restaurant quite a lot and so booked a table for 8 people to celebrate two birthdays. We were seated straight away and ordered drinks which came quite quickly. It then went downhill from there! Every other table had their order taken apart from ours - there was only one waitress running around taking orders and also having to serve at the bar. Bearing in mind we booked a table for 7.15pm we did not receive our main courses until after 8.30! The staff were great but the managers really need to sort out staffing issues. The food was ok but I have definitely had better there. When the bill came up they did not apologise for the long wait and offer a discount/drink on the house. We felt sorry for the staff but on principal just paid our bill and left. Would I return to this restaurant - I wouldn't rush!!
tripadvisor,eng,-1,food;service,"One burger, one portabella burger, onion rings, calamari and nachos.  Regular burger, pretty good.  Portobello burger, okay.Calamari and onion rings, frozen products. Nachos, worst i ever had.  No sour cream “oh we don’t have sour cream anymore”, it’s on the menu, the cheese is a glop of orange that makes ‘cheezewhiz’ gourmet.  Sent them back."

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;environment,"Excellent food, wonderful attentive service, fantastic atmosphere. This will become our favourite restaurant in Amsterdam! The quality of the produce, and the depth of flavour of the satays - we ordered pork belly, chicken and succulent steak satays, is unlike any other Indonesian restaurant we've eaten at - both here in Amsterdam and across Asia. Not only was the service impeccable and warm, the overall ambience, on the fifth floor on top of a department store is unique and provides a cavernous, but still cosy space in which to dine. The menu is broad, and if you enjoy rich Asian flavours with authentic ingredients you'll be happily sated here. We booked late - at 5,30 pm for a 6.00 pm seating and were happily accommodated on a Wednesday evening. The decor is something wonderful and eclectic, the views of Amsterdam an added bonus. Loved the open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant and it was clear to us that everyone who worked here had a passion for being there. Thank you Ron GastroBar Indonesia - it was a treat! We've made it our quest to find as many good Indonesian restaurants to try in our new home in Amsterdam (we relocated from Sydney, Australia last month) and are convinced we will not find better than this restaurant for the type of food we love."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"On visiting this Steakhouse on a fairly busy evening service the first thing that was noticeable was that nobody in the place was ordering the Steak....do the locals know something?Not being local, we ordered two Sirloin Steaks.  Both were rare despite one being ordered as medium.  The Sirloin itself was full of fat, sinewy, gristly....so much so the steak knife was struggling to cut through!  Not convinced we were served Sirloin, certainly not £32 quality.The sides weren't much better, the Onion rings which are served in a pot looked OK at first but when you got to the ones at the bottom they were barely fried, wet, sloppy and looked disgusting.On the whole the food was of poor quality, overprice and in parts under-cooked."

Eventually you’ll give up and leave, warning new arrivals that the hosts don't seem to want people to come. Another bar will happily serve you. "

We were served by the lovely Aneta it was Saturday night and we had three courses in an hour and twenty minutes ! The service was fab, we both had the fillet with various sides and it was amazing, it is fairly loud in there because of the building itself as people have said but they had music on and it still felt cosy. we had 3 courses, glass of wine, 2 bottled beers and a G&T for under £100 so for the quality of the steak I found it reasonable there are much cheaper options on the menu, We will be back I’m sure 👍🏻"

tripadvisor,eng,0,service;food,"We were welcomed quickly at the door and directed to seats at the bar downstairs where it was so dark that I had to use my mobile phone torch to read the menu. The staff were very helpful, brought us water, and gave very good advice on the menu, on the amount of food to order and suggested we cancelled our proposed order of rice as there would be nothing to eat it with (we had also ordered bread) which proved to be absolutely correct. Food was brought very rapidly, so we were out in just over an hour (we weren't rushed though, and did not have dessert). Although the Lemongrass Saison beer I had was delicious, as was my companion's (heavily iced) lime soda, the same could not be said of the food. We started with the corn kachumber which tasted like sweetcorn in a mildly spiced gloopy sauce, and moved on to the smoked mackerel, which was like supermarket pate bulked out with a light mayonnaise, followed by the bhel puri which didn't tast of mango at all - one just experienced the smooth texture of the creamy topping and the crunchiness of everything underneath. Finally the garlic and coriander stem (just like a supermarket naan) came with two overcooked lamb chops my partner (who loves lamb chops) could not finish one and donated it to me - as I am less of a connoisseur of this dish I finished most of it. Throughout our glasses of water were topped up regularly and the servers chatted with us in a very genuine and friendly manner, attended to any other needs as required, finally bringing the bill very promptly."

Over de jaren heen heb ik het zien evolueren: meer fast food, kwantiteit boven kwaliteit. Vandaag een aperitief besteld en 2 burgers met bijpassende biertjes. De aperitief (van het huis, volgens de kaart gebaseerd op de ice tea met citroengras en komkommer maar in realiteit rood, mierzoet en met framboos?) stond nog geen 5 minuten op tafel en daar waren de burgers al. Bediening met weinig oog voor de klant. Ook de burger was enorm doorbakken en niet smaakvol. Absoluut geen aangename restaurant ervaring, niet de service die we kennen van vroeger. Jammer."

The steak was cooked perfectly and was full of flavour, Chloe carved it as requested across the grain and it was very tender.We requested gravy as the mushroom sauce although very tasty was served in a small dish and was a small portion even though we ordered 2 each.The ambiance in the restaurant was pleasant an all the staff were attentive, the food excellent an overall a very pleasant meal"

Still sat us very quickly. The waitress who served was lovely and kept checking we were having a nice time and if we needed anything. Even took a few pics for us. 3 out of the 5 meals were brilliant however the other 2 were slightly over done but still enjoyable. Just surprising for a steak restaurant when it's what they specialise in to over do it. Wasn't worth complaining about as still enjoyable. Had a few puddings which were mostly great but the brownie was quite bland, we mentioned it to the waitress who offered to replace but we didnt want anything else so took it off the bill which was nice. In all we would come back but maybe not in a hurry. It was a nice meal with great service but still lots of other potentially nicer places around."

I was brought a small chocolate with coffee and the kids eyed this up...the waiter saw this and brought over extra chocs.... really nice touch!We observed a couple being seated just before 7, the staff enquired if they had theatre tickets explaining it was unlikely they would be able to complete a meal and get to the start of the theatre.....again, I was impressed at the attention to detail and concern for their customers.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,food;service;value,"This pasta joint serves you overcooked pasta with sauces that lacks a punch. We ordered the seasonal ""the (im)possible bavet"" and a spaghetti based on the ""hot tomato sauce"" 🍅. Both were severely underwhelming, with overcooked pasta so far from al dente it felt more like mush than 🍝. The bavet was under seasoned and lacked spices. The hot tomato was so mild that the ketchup gave it a run for it's money, it also tasted like the tomato base came from a can and it looked like the parmesan came pre-grated in a bag. There was also plenty of water accumulated in the bottom of the bowl, unfortunately I didn't order a minestrone soup. The spaghetti seemed like your run of the mill dry pasta from the supermarket, while dry pasta is fine and can be flavorful and delicious you need to treat it right (like your partner), unlike what this place does.

If you order from the special menu it shouldn’t mean you  get a considerable less amount of food.I’m not a big eater but this was just ridiculous . Will not be going back 
tripadvisor,nld,1,food;service;value,"We zijn de eerste keer in Bavet komen eten. We gingen aan een tafeltje op terras zitten en er kwam direct een enthousiaste, vriendelijke serveerster aan onze tafel om uitleg te geven over de menukaart. Nadat onze bestelling was opgenomen, bleek er een probleem te zijn: er was slechts 1 portie glutenvrije spaghetti over en iemand anders had op dat moment ook glutenvrije spaghetti besteld. De serveerster heeft het probleem goed opgelost door de andere persoon te vragen of hij/zij een ander soort spaghetti wou nemen. Daarna werden we snel bediend. Mijn man had The Billy Bunter Horse genomen, ik de Bavet Special Dog. Het was allebei heel lekker, ruime porties."
tripadvisor,nld,-1,service,"Onze eerste ervaring hier was super, nu weer eens zin in een heerlijke hamburger, maar wat een teleurdtelling. 19.30 hr en wij werden weggestuurd hoewel het terras bijna leeg was, foto's als bewijs. Onder het mom dat ze toch zooo veel vertraging hadden. Begrijpen wie kan. Jammer genoeg ons laatste bezoek. Terwijl we bijdeburen genoten van een lekkere maaltijd werden niet minder dan 20tal potentiele klanten weggedtuurd."

Ainda quis acreditar que tivesse sido um mau dia numa loja específica, mas aparentemente é recorrente e transversal a várias lojas. Serviram-me de um jarro, apesar de terem a máquina disponível. Pelos vistos, sumo que já teria estado ao ar. Não repito, nem o sumo nem uma Padaria Portuguesa. "

Good though, and not too expensive for London. We paid £30 each for the shared meal. One small gripe, they automatically add 20% “discretionary” service to the bill. For a restaurant with very harried waiters who give very scant attention to each table, slapping the food down and running, and removing plates while people are still eating, 20% is too much."

Aangezien het er met zo veel nogal luidruchtig aan toe gaat, was dit de beste oplossing. Even moeten wachten op het drinken, wat te begrijpen is met zo een bende, die dan nog allemaal speciale drankjes koos.Eerst namen we wat voor gerechten om te delen (nacho's, calamares,...), dewelke bij iedereen in de smaak vielen. Mijn lamshamburger met guacamole was zeker lekker. Als sidedish koos ik voor de jacked patato met zure room, welke ook zeer lekker was. Ik kreeg deze wel pas nadat mijn burger op was, maar dit stoorde mij niet, want de bediening was echt wel constant in de weer om alles naar tafel te brengen.Nadien geen klachten gehoord van de collega's (allen aan het werk in een ander restaurant in Aalst)Lekker eten, sympathieke bediening,...

Was advised to phone the resturant directly, they knew all about my e-mail and head office response, so everything was dealt with immediately without any problem at all. A later phone call from head office to check that all was well and to discuss other generalities. All in all, a very nice company to deal with. We will be going back again."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;reputation;value;service,"My wife always frequents this, or similar Spaghetti Houses, when she visits London and always comes back saying how good they are. Since we were in London together I bowed to her suggestion that we visit this particular establishment but, in my opinion, it was a mistake. I ordered the special Lobster starter and was dismayed with what arrived: two miserable bits of lobster on top of a load of Marie Rose sauce containing about 5 small prawns and one other minuscule piece of lobster - possibly 1 oz of Lobster in total and at an excruciating price of £14.50 - and I know it's London but this is an outrageous price for a rip-off dish.To be fair the Pizza our grandson had looked very good and my wife's veal escalope also seemed fine.However, to top it all, my wife volunteered to pay the bill and, without looking at it properly, added a further 10% to the total - and the waitress surprisingly (or not) failed to point out that the 12.5% service had already be added!! I wonder how many tourists are scammed this way. Needless to say, I most certainly won't be going back EVER."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service;reputation,"I have been to many a Spaghetti House over the years and whilst I have never found any of them outstanding, in the past we have always had a most enjoyable meal.Not so this time. Three of us sat down at 7.35pm on a Wednesday night . We ordered drinks, nibbles and three pastas.The drinks and nibbles arrived reasonably quickly after about ten minutes but that was it. At 8.25 I asked the waitress where our food had got to and she went behind the bar, maybe to see the manager who wasn't there or look for the order , I don't know, then she ignored us completely, saying nothing . She started talking to another table's diners.The manager wasn't to be seen immediately although he was at the front of the restaurant talking to a customer.Another member of staff was approached by my wife and said he wasn't anything to do with the kitchen ( although he was a waiter) and frankly couldn't care less. I remonstrated with him to be told "" good night, go!"". I approached our waitress who studiously ignored me . I actually wanted to pay for the drinks we had had, but having been told to go already and having been ignored we just upped and left.This restaurant should be one of the jewels in the Crown for Spaghetti House being in a major tourist spot in London, only yards away from Piccadilly and Leicester Square. The service badly let the place down. I presume they had forgotten our order for some reason. However the place wasn't full and no explanation was offered. Other people who had come in maybe 20 minutes after us were served well before I complained.Having waited 50 minutes for three plates of pasta we were hungry and fed up. I appreciate the place will be full most of the time with unsuspecting tourists who won't know better but the Spaghetti House chain has lost one fan at least and we will never return. I have reviewed well over a hundred restaurants on Trip Advisor and this is the first time I have given only one star.A pity,"
tripadvisor,eng,-1,service;food,"Besides the view and location there isn’t much else good about this place.  There were 6 of us and it didn’t look very busy.  We waited forever to order. When we finally ordered- the waitress was rude and she couldn’t be bothered.  One of us in our group ordered a gluten free bun and burger and she barely even knew what that was or cared. We received our order- and the gluten free burger was practically raw.  We brought it to the attention of the waitress and again she really didn’t care.  We had already eaten some of it.  she didn’t apologize-  it was more that she said we had eaten a bite. Well of course a bite was eaten-  that’s how we noticed it was raw on the inside. After we asked the 2nd time, she said ok- we can give u a free glass of wine.  It was just a terrible experience-  and by no means inexpensive.Don’t go here -  not worth it.  Try another place where they want your business."

Na 5 minuten te staan wachten op iemand om ons een tafel toe te wijzen, gingen we zitten. Na 10 minuten hadden we nog steeds geen menukaart gekregen. Na verschillende keren onze vinger opgestoken te hebben en steeds luider ""mevrouw"" te zeggen, bleef de dame op het terras ons gewoon negeren. We vroegen de menukaart dan maar aan een jobstudent die net toevallig passeerde. We bestelden twee burgers met friet en twee drankjes. Dit alles kwam na een 25tal minuten op tafel en was echt heerlijk! Een van de beste burgers die ik ooit heb gegeten! Toen we de rekening wilden, begon het staaltje slechte bediening echter opnieuw. De dame op het terras keek ons zelfs niet aan en nadat we aan 2 (!) Verschillende obers de rekening hadden gevraagd en die nog steeds niet hadden gekregen, zijn we maar zelf naar binnen gegaan om te betalen.Jammer van de slechte bediening, want de burgers zijn hier heerlijk!

I would definitely recommend the three course meal option as it helps save a couple of pounds if you’re looking to have an appetizer with the main meal. The calamari was really fresh and tasty. The spaghetti plate included in the meal was really good and the noodles felt and tasted fresh. The sauce however was slightly a little too liquid but didn’t really ruin the plate itself. I had the panna cotta which was amazing topped with fresh mixed berries. Overall great experience at a restaurant centrally located near all the London attractions.

I ended up asking if our food was coming shortly, because it was 9pm and we were considering cancelling our order and looking for something quick elsewhere. The staff were lovely and very apologetic- I asked one waitress if they were short-staffed as we received our entreè, and she explained that they were missing people in the kitchen and out the front. We were also given a discount without having to ask, which we appreciated.We would have appreciated it even more, however, if we had been informed that there would be a long wait when we first asked for a table. While we understand that this may have resulted in lost business for the restaurant (we probably would have chosen to go elsewhere), it would have prevented dissatisfied customers!"

tripadvisor,deu,-1,food;service,"Die Bedienungen im Jilles Beer & Burgers sind überdurchschnittlich schlecht! Um etwas zu bestellen muss man quer durch das Restaurant den Kellern rufen, damit dieser einen überhaupt beachten. Obwohl man ja zuvor bereits (wait here till you’re seated) an den Tisch begleitet wurde und die Karte entgegen geschmissen bekam. Das Essen ist leider genauso trocken und geschmacklos, wie der Service. - Überfrittiert (sehr wahrscheinlich zu altes Frittierfett)- trocken (die Burgerbanns haben keinen Tropfen Soße gesehen) - fertig soßen (sofern an die Soße gedacht worden ist) - fertig Patty, welches schwarze Sohlen hatte...-auf fast noch volle Teller, die abgeräumt wurden, kam gar keine Nachfrage ob es geschmeckt habeUnd das alles für einen abartig teuren Preis! NIE WIEDER! P.S.: wir waren nicht die einzigen mit den benannten Problemen. Während wir die Karte studierten und anschließen (leider) dort aßen, verließen mehrere Gäste ihre Tische im Restaurant, weil sie vergeblich versuchten einen Kellner zu bekommen, welches Ihnen schlichtweg nicht möglich war.

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;environment;food,"Visited here on the  19/4/19. Ordered ham and leek croquettes for starter which cane with some sort of dip. For mains I had prime middletons grill which included 6oz fillet steak, per peri chicken breast on the bone, lamb cutlet, sticky bbq ribs, onion rings & spring onion garnish. I had a jug of nice cold water on the table to drink and bottled coke. I think the total cost was around £35. First of all the building it's self is stunning and a really nice place with a chilled environment good for all occasions. I took my brother for his birthday who had been having a bad time and it Instantly put a smile on his face. The food came and everything was fresh and pleasant on the pallet with the starter. The main was really, really nice. I ordered mine with thick cut wedges. This meal is certainly not fair the smaller appetite! The chicken was divine, the lamb and ribs well seasoned and well cooked, onion rings on point. However the steak which was the star of the show was nice and still very juicy however just slightly over how I asked it for and the wedges a tiny bit sharp I. The mouth however don't let this out you off, the food here is killer. There was a large party there when we were there and the staff were more than able to keep up eoth all there requests by the look of it. Well worth a try. "

Yes it’s that good!The three course was exceptional value, and yes it’s gone up one whole whole pound, but you’d still be hard pressed to beat it. The service, the staff, the food and value for money all got 10/10.Yesterday’s visit was lack lustre, service was far from attentive, sadly the new menu menu has lost the fantastic Tempranillo. The lunch time menu had changed too, but that never a bad thing, but sadly the fish and chicken (personal favourites) have been dropped - tried the chipolata with a honey mustard dip. Insipid looking sausages with a fat top sweet sauce- will not have that again. Mains; both had steaks where great!Deserts; the sticky toffee was lacking its sauce (shame) and I tried the Creme Brûlée - oh dear, this is my favourite pud ever! And it was scrambled. Sadly a chef that can not cook this should not be left in the kitchen, more so, they should know when not to serve certain food.Let’s hope it’s better next time."

We wandered into the restaurant kind of late because it was one of the few places close to us that looked like it was still serving dinner and wouldn't take a long time. I loved the food! I had a chicken burger and croquettes (probably a little too much food, but I was on vacation!) My husband had the Vol au Vent and it was much better than the same dish I'd had the night before at a ""nicer"" restaurant for a more expensive price.  We didn't have any issues with service, but it may have been because it was closer to closing time and not as busy.  I liked the food so much that we ate here on our next stop in Mechelen."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"We were staying in ahotel in the vicinity and on our last night in Berlin, late in the evening we decided to have a quick Italian meal. Vapiano was the nearest walking distance Italian on TripAdvisor.The restaurant serves freshly prepared food for which you have to queue...it is a self service restaurant. The food is prepared at separate counters depending on whether you want a bowl of pasta, a pizza, a starter, a drink or lasagne (which is not served at the pasta counter but for some reason at the pizza counter...) BUT (and this is a big BUT)  there is nowhere any directions as to where you should queue and for what. So now you see why I suggest you dine alone and queue for one dish only. Otherwise you will spend another 20-30 minutes queueing again. Going there with a group expecting to eat together is impossible for different dishes are prepared at totally different speeds.We spent quite a while in there...queueing. The food was atrocious, the staff surly and uninterested, the bruchetta simply bread and tomatoes, the arrabiata bland and insipid and by the time my companion's pizza was ready we left it behind untouched and ran.By the way, you pay regardless whether the food is edible or not or whether you eat it or not.I suppose if you are hungry enough and stumble on this place by accident and it is the only place left open and you are alone, you way give a bowl of pasta a try. Otherwise avoid at all cost. Not only is it not worth going there, in my view, it is better to go hungry."

The minute steak cooked medium/rare to perfection, my son chose the steak baguette which he said was tasty and very filling, as well as the burger my daughter chose. We all ate, chatted leisurely as we do as a family and not once were we made to feel rushed or left unattended, which considering Kayleigh waited on all the tables mainly by herself and was rushed off her feet as it was busy for a Monday evening.

Het eten zelf te veel dezelfde smaak.Ook na het laten verwijderen van de koriander die echt overal werd opgedaan, bleef de smaak nog eenzijdig.Toen we opmerkten dat het niet lusten van koriander  (de zogenaamde zeepsmaak waarvan onderzoek aangetoond heeft dat het een genengeval is) een goede reden is om dat toch te vermelden op de kaart, werden daarover vriendelijk de verantwoordelijkheid bij ons gelegd. Wij hadden dit namelijk moeten melden, werd ons meegedeeld. Daar waar bv de betere Mexicaan dit wel op z'n kaart meldt. Naast de vlakke smaak, valt op te merken dat de aangeboden kaart niet bulkt van de creativiteit over mogelijkheden met kip. Er lijkt vooral gemikt op een zo laag mogelijke foodkost. Dit vertaalt zich duidelijk in menumogelijkheden en de smaak. Het interieur is tof maar van 'n interieur alleen eet je niet. "

Service is OK -- the staff are not overly friendly, sometimes it's like they just don't want to be there.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,food;experience;value, I’ll jump straight in to the foodreview. I tried the asian pork and my company had the goatcheese salad. The flavor of my pork was very good. All in all I was really pleased with my food. The goatcheese salad looked good but was quite bland and a bit booring in flavor. But overall was ok. As for service. Well they were friendly and that’s about all the nice things I can say. Now for the bad part. First of it’s expensive for the simple fact that they don’t cook your food they just plate it up. To start with I was served the salmondish. I handen it back and within a minute they came out with my pork. Not because they accidently had it readymade in the back but because that’s how long it takes to put on a plate. Now on to my dates salad. It lacken dressing so We asked for more. It was missing pears which We had to ask about and got the explanation that ”pears was out of season”. Ok? How about explaining it before We order the food.  You might think that with all those problems it was a packed place or busy. But there was only us and one more couple in the entire restaurant. And we were the only ones eating. I might consider coming back for the pork if the lower the cost about 30kr and wanted a quick meal.

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,"My wife and I ate here on a Sunday evening. It is fairly local to us but we have not been for a while.The place was busy but not full, there were plenty of staff to wait on us, our particular waitress was Evie, who although young and only working there a few weeks was polite, professional and competent.We were not ravenously hungry, so opted for some shared nibbles of Olives and Pork scratchings as a starter.My wife had a steak with new potatoes, I had the seafood mixed grill with caeser salad and onion rings. Food was served hot and promptly with no real wait after our starters.We were both happy with our main dishes, but I was disappointed with the caeser salad. What was served was a good sized portion of lettuce with a caeser style sauce and a few very small croutons, not in my opinion what a proper caeser salad should be, as the egg, anchovies and parmesan cheese were missing.However this would not prevent us from going back, I may just choose a different side dish to my meal."

tripadvisor,nld,-1,service,Bij binnenkomst bleek het restaurant een stuk groter dan verwacht. We werden naar een tafel gebracht waar de medewerker zonder iets te zeggen meteen weg liep. Na 5 tot 10 minuten kwam er iemand anders om een drankje op te nemen en we hebben ook meteen maar eten besteld.De drankjes duurde vervolgens nog even voor deze kwamen. Toen de burgers eenmaal kwamen bleken deze van een goed formaat te zijn. Hierdoor zijn ze echter wel lastig te eten. Ook de smaak kan beter. De saus ernaast was echt nodig om het smaak te geven. De bediening was verder met name ongeïnteresseerd en kortaf. Dit kan echt nog veel beter.Uiteindelijk maar geen dessert genomen.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,value;food;service,"Me and my family arrived in this restaurant for dinner on a regular Tuesday night. We ordered drinks — which included a homemade ice tea. When the drinks arrived the server gave me two glasses of ice tea instead of one and wasn’t even fully loaded. Just half of the glass. For 3,5€!! The ice tea was good but that stops here. Ordered nachos but it arrived 15 minutes later: regular tortilla chips with Parmesan cheese on it. No tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream... just shredded Parmesan. Then, the chicken arrived. On the menu it doesn’t mentioned that it’s SOAKED in super super sugary barbecue sauce.  It was absolutely disgusting. 13€ for 3 chicken tacos soaked in barbecue sauce. Didn’t even include fries. Why isn’t it written on the menu that the sauce is sweet barbecue? It doesn’t say anything on the menu so I was expecting regular chicken with province herbs or something like that. My mom ordered salad but there was no dressing on it. Last but not least, the servers never asked how was the food, so we just couldn’t even tell them to bring dressing for the salad. I don’t know if you eat raw lettuce? But I personally but vinaigrette on it to add taste. Finally, when we paid they messed up the order and charged the ice tea twice and that was their error. Never coming back to this restaurant ever. It’s a shame. "

The espresso shot clearly not tamped enough before pulling the shot, the shot too short for a double and crema non-existant. Costa express service station bad. The espresso martinis were even worse. In fact, the worst I have ever had - the pre-made ones you get at music festivals are somehow superior. The ratio of vodka to coffee liqueur was way off (not even sure the latter was included) plus all of the pitfalls of the espresso shot that are mentioned above.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"We visited Middleton‘s for lunch last month for my partners birthday. And was put in a pokey table in the corner right next to the food hatch. And it just went downhill from there! There was only four of us, we waited 15 minutes for our drinks and a further hour for our main meals. The gentleman serving us was polite and friendly enough but the waiting time was just ridiculous. We had only put two hours on our car parking ticket meaning we had to rush food and get out the door very very quickly. We were offered a £10 discount on our meal which was kind but rushing our food just ruined our meal! My partner visited again last night with a group of friends and was given poor service poor drinks and poor food. Very disappointing. We won’t be back ! "

It finally showed up and it wasn't worth the wait. It was warm not hot. They are so disorganized .... Too many kids working. Go somewhere else and don't give them any business because the best thing that can happen for this restaurant is that it can go out of business. "

Na 1,5u wachten komen ze zeggen dat er iets is misgelopen en dat ze net aan het eten begonnen zijn, maar ze boden ons wel elk een gratis drankje aan maar ook daar klopten de aantallen in het drinken weer niet... Ik had de taco's besteld en die kip was koud, bij de rest viel de smaak wel beter mee. Na de rekening te vragen bleek daar ook weer een fout in gekropen zijn,hadden ze ons 10 euro te veel aangerekend.

One of the meals was not the correct order, rather than taking the whole meal the fries were taken away. The wedges were then brought after having to ask again for them. The chips on the other meals had obviously been sat for ages and were hard, the wedges were not cooked enough. As for the sticky ribs, dry and tasteless. The restaurant was not busy at all and the staff were not attentive. Been here before and had fantastic food so this was a real let down for my daughters birthday meal."

Yesterday we made our 1st visit to ‘Ellis Gourmet Burger’.We will not be visiting again!!!They must be short staffed as we only saw 2 people working... Actually we only saw one girl working (I must admit that she was very polite).To cut a long story short, the burgers arrived.. ‘funky chicken’ burger was tough, stringy and over cooked. The mayonnaise on the burger was like water!! And don’t ask me to tell you what the vegetables were that were inside the burger as they were unrecognisable!!! The ‘sides’ arrived without the dips, and as there was no one around, I had to go inside the restaurant to find someone to ask for a dip!When it came to paying, (the system is that you take the ticket given to you by the waiting staff at the beginning of the meal into the restaurant and pay at the till) I had to wait to get into the restaurant to pay and eventually had to say ‘excuse me’ to a staff member and his friend who were laughing and joking around in the doorway, completely oblivious of me trying to get in a young girl trying to get out!!!The owners of the restaurant are either unaware of the state of the food and staff, or just don’t really care, as the restaurant will continue to do well due to the amount of tourists that visit Bruges on a daily basis and the fact that the decor looks ‘trendy’ and attractive to younger adults and teens!!If you value a good meal, don’t eat here."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,"Booked a table by phone last week for yesterday - my friend arrived before me and gave them my name - couldnt' find the booking anywhere!  Luckily they had a spare table. After I arrived our meal. Mine was a 'blue' sirloin steak. Cooked to perfection but stone cold, so the waiter told the manager and they said they would cook another. When they brought the second steak out, it was a fair bit thinner (!) and grisley..however, to avoid more hue har, I ate it. I think though the second steak was one that would have been cooked for their 'special' lunchtime deal whereas I had ordered a £12 sirloin. However I must say the manager was very good and didn't charge for the meal, but I feel this should be fed back so that they are a bit more diligent in the future. I could have got a much nicer steak in the local pub, but Middletons is supposed to be superior to the pubs ..... definitely not yesterday!  We are not after a free meal - we had one yesterday - just want the standard to improve.

Overall it was just average and for the price we paid would rather spend a tiny bit more and go to Miller and Carter for a great steak and accompaniments!"

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;family_friendly,"While visiting Utrecht we wanted to have ribs & burgers but not in a fast food restaurant where it’s all full so we decided to try Fridays out and see if same as abroad as the sitting area is bigger and more quieter .We had the lunch set menu selection for 14€ where you can choose a starter , main course and a drink and were not disappointed!it was just what we wanted without spending a fortune for lunch being on a day trip. mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, fries and the ribs were excellent and tender!They also have kids menu with two small burgers which is perfect if kids not too hungry or want to share . Just the margarita for lunch was maybe too much but it’s one of the drink selections included in the price . Service very friendly and guest orientated especially the Greek server .And for those who likes sports you know there are always TVs around the restaurant. Toilets very clean"

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;food,"My Family and I have been to Middletons Kings Lynn on many a family occasion birthday’s and anniversary etc and have had an amazing time with great customer service however this evening for my birthday we have experienced the worst customer service I think I have ever seen or received and also some of the coldest meals. Our trouble started when we had our starters delivered and our garlic mushrooms were stone cold, we wait for about 5 minutes to see if a waiter/waitress would do a check back but no one could be seen I eventually when and found someone how took the mushrooms away and came back within 3-4 mins with piping hot ones  which I can only assume was ding technology at its finest however we gave them the benefit of the doubt as I said we had great times here. After finish our started we had to wait 30 minutes for them to be cleared and then another 15 before we had to ask where our mains were. After asking were they where if by magic they appeared ! We had the 2 steak and sticky’s and one fillet steak. The fillet steak was actually cook amazing however the rest of he meals we could not say the same... cold ribs and Luke warm steaks. When eventually a check back was done we did mention about it but were greet with I’m sorry to hear that and she then walked off. No though about a replacement meal or any type of way to solve a situation. After finishing our cold meals we then had to wait another 15 minutes for someone to come and clear our table, we asked for the bill which then took a further 10Minutes... However if the waiter had move that fast when delivering our food like he did collecting the payment from us I wouldn’t be writing this review... really disappointed.. even when we did complain the manager on shift disappeared and left the poor lad deal with it."

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;value,"We visited Middleton during our wedding anniversary getaway to Colchester. We have family here, one who is a chef, and they recommended the restaurant to us, which we thought was a good sign.My husband had the chicken wings for a starter, whilst I stuck to the mixed olives.For mains, my husband had the surf and turf and I had a bacon cheese burger. I did ask for the smaller patty, but got given and then charged for the larger burger. But I was happy, so didn't raise the issue.You get a choice of sides with your meal, and they are not just standard sides. For example, you can get dauphinoise potatoes, Feta salads etc. We were boring though and just got fries and sweet potato fries.We also ordered dessert. Middletones sundea and creme brulee. Now we waited over half an hour for these. For us, it wasn't an issue as we were enjoying the ambience of the restaurant. But the waitress insisted on taking the desserts off the bill, which was very thoughtful of her.All of this with 2 drinks would of come to just over £58. With our desserts taken off, we paid £47.Very good value for money in our opinion, and the food tasted great 👍"
tripadvisor,eng,1,food;value;environment;service,The stuff is very polite and helpful. Great communication in English. The menu is very simple but gives you numerous of choices. Had dinner there three time during the trip. The only negative (which is subjective) is the high prices.

Waited a long time for our food; another couple who sat down after us were served before us. Between the 3 of us we had a burger, 2 servings of Tacos, 2 servings of fries, an apple juice (small) and a coke (250ml). The bill was over €50 which is ridiculously expensive. Avoid unless you like paying well over the odds for below average food and mediocre service "
tripadvisor,eng,-1,service,"Food was a bit better than OK, which for lunch and a brew on the run in acceptable.  What is not acceptable is the bald guy who responded to the what is your name ? is ""Waiter"" He was rude and made a comment.  My burger came with a side of coleslaw, I asked for a fork,  Waiter said, ""We don't put out forks and knives during ""Pride week"", or we will lose them all"".   I ordered a beer, a .5L, it came with a foam head way below the .5 line, and I commented, so he almost threw another one at me.  We were disappointed with the whole experience.

Our waitress Jade Curley was incredibly attentive and made sure our drinks were always full and we had a smile on our face! The food was exceptional also!

tripadvisor,eng,-1,service;food,"We visited the Jilles Beer & Burger, at around 8:20pm. As you enter the outside area there is a sign to wait to be seated. We were waiting here for nearly 10 minutes before a young man approached us. He was moody all through out our visit and did not take us to a table just shrugged to choose a seat outside. We were not given menus until a different waiter noticed us and asked if we were okay. The food is quite expensive for what you get. A burger with salad and no fries starts at €15! We eventually had our order taken and our food came quite fast, but this might of been because they close at 9pm (which we did not know until googling) and the waiters began to rush around cleaning as we ate. Nobody told us they were closing. We were not brought serviettes or cutlery and they got my friends drink and food wrong. My friend ordered nachos  and they came with nothing on!! €8 for a bowl of nachos with no cheese or sauce? We complained and this was corrected. Although, the staff do not seem happy to help and act as though you are a burden. I ordered the cheesy nelson burger which had a revolting sauce that seemed like they had just plopped tomato pizza base sauce in a burger. The meat was chewy and I had a mountain of greens of ridiculous size in the bun too. Finally, the only time our waiter seemed happy was when I asked to pay. Overall, I would not recommend this place. We left annoyed as our total came to over €30 for what seemed like nothing.            A V O I D!! "
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food,Opted for a rump steak cooked medium rare which came with fries a mushroom and a half tomato.The steak was served medium and had little flavour. The tomato was a dwarf variety and the mushroom had so much salt  in it i think it had been caught fresh from the sea that day. The fries were fine!
tripadvisor,nld,-1,food;service,"2x een burger met frietjes en een bijgerechten besteld. Eten kwam pas na 45min, hoewel er amper volk was. Toen het eten er eindelijk was, bleken het twee foute burgers te zijn (als in: een volledig andere bestelling). Dit was misschien te wijten aan de ober die zo rap-rap onze bestelling had opgenomen dat we ons afvroegen of hij het wel verstaan had. Frietjes werden wel al op tafel gezet, wat een beetje raar is gezien die direct afkoelen. Kort daarna kregen we gelukkig de hamburgers die we besteld hadden, echter bleken deze lauw te zijn. Bovendien zat er geen crumble op onze asperges met crumble (die waren ze ""vergeten""). De burgers (classic cheese bacon & beetroot) waren wel lekker. Spijtig van de nalatigheid bij de bediening/keuken."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;food,I had submitted a poor review after an unpleasant dining experience in February. I was subsequently contacted by their Guest Relations Manager who to her credit very kindly offered a voucher so that we'd return to see if the promised improvements had materialised. In passing my son & I popped in for the fixed menu lunch on 13 July intending to use the voucher.The food was ok this time (compared with our last visit) but service was so slow. 2.5 hrs for 2 courses of the fixed menu is not ok & the manager didn't think so either. He appeared to share our frustration and after my explanation regarding the voucher he refused to accept it & remarkably gave us the meal for free & asked us to come back with the voucher another time. He & his waiting staff were trying their best to keep other patrons happy with free drinks and discounted bills but I've never experienced a situation where so many customers were simultaneously  complaining about either the food or their wait.Sadly we left after 2 courses & went to another restaurant for dessert. This restaurant has so much potential so it's very disappointing to have had another poor experience.
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;value;environment,"Visited yesterday with a friend and our children. My friend had been before several times and always enjoyed it so recommended we go there. We both had fixed price 3 course menu and the children had the kids 3 course meal, one big and two little kids. Starters were fine. My two children had the kids burger for their main course. Their meals were exactly the same despite one ordering big kids and one ordering small kids. Neither liked their burgers as they tasted burnt so just ate the chips. Maybe this is because they are chargrilled but I imagine most kids would prefer a burger which didn't taste burnt. My beanburger and chips was fine but very basic, no side salad or anything, you would expect a bit more from a restaurant like this. The desserts were a shambles. One child ordered chocolate fudge brownie with no ice cream but it came with ice cream. One child ordered build your own banana split which was supposed to come with sprinkles, choc buttons and chopped strawberries according to the menu. What arrived was half a banana, cut in half with a lump of ice cream. We had to ask for the other things and were told they didn't do choc buttons any more. One adult ordered sticky toffee pudding and custard and received the tiniest toddler sized piece of pudding, with ice cream, not custard. The manager did take the kids meals off the bill but it was still disappointing. The other adult pudding was also tiny. Maybe they were small because we had the fixed price menu but they really were smaller than a child's portion. Add to this the toilet lights were flashing like strobe lights and there was no toilet roll whatsoever, not even an empty tube in the bin so someone had obviously cleared it away and not replaced it. I won't be returning."
tripadvisor,eng,1,food;service;environment,"All the staff were charming, multilingual, helpful and generally lovely. The service, contrary to other reviews, was so quick that I'd barely started my drink before the food arrived. The food was as you'd expect, like a Belgian version of Nando's, ie quite good. I don't understand the complaints in other reviews - perhaps you get the service your attitude deserves."

Inedible starter of zucchine fritte. Described as crispy zucchini, arrived as cold, damp flaccid bits of zucchini in rubbery batter. As far from crispy as you can get. Garlic bread had no taste whatsoever. Main course of spag Bol (which I ordered because I though that this was pretty impossible to mess up) was luke warm, but passable. Just. Tried an afogato (again ... the safe choice?). Which arrived after the ice cream had melted. Honestly... you have to try hard to serve food this bad. Ps. Waiting staff trying their very best.

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;value;reputation,"I selected Spaghetti House on Woodstock St for a quick lunch as I had never been and reviews were decent.Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the quality of the dishes. Whilst the food was cooked just fine, the dishes lacked any flavour. We had ordered the calamari and the breaded mozzarella balls as a starter, as well as 2 coke drinks. The mozzarella balls were fine with the sauce provided (probably the most flavoured item of our lunch) but the calamari was rubbery and tasteless. As our mains, we ordered a simple pesto dish and a meatball dish. It was as if an entire jar of pesto had been added to the spaghetti and yet I still had to add pepper and salt as this dish was bland. The meatballs seemed a bit raw in the middle but when we checked with our server, she said that the kitchen said this was how it was cooked. Again, the dish was bland. We eat at many restaurants and don't mind paying a bit more for good food but when the bill came, and it was over £53, I thought the quality of food was poor and not worth that at all. This disappointed me as I had selected the restaurant because I had a craving for spaghetti. Sadly, this did not satisfy my craving well. The only reason I did not rate the restaurant one TripAd circle was due to the friendly service. I know this is a chain but I thought the food would taste better and be better value for money.Disappointing."

He is the best thing about this restaurant, even more so than the food.I probably wouldn't go back, as in not convinced it's value for money but if I did, I hope Ivan serves us!"
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service;value;reputation,"Where do I even start? And I’m not one to slate somewhere unless necessary- but seriously, do not visit this restaurant! I’ve always wondered why it’s pretty much empty most days- now I know why.Appalling, rude, unprofessional staff, average food (my chicken was rock solid, the potatoes were pretty much raw, the only bearable dish was the carbonara), overpriced- just so so awful. There are plenty of delicious Italian restaurants in London so don’t waste your time here. The Holborn staff are particularly bad, awful customer service. My colleagues and I work opposite but will never ever return! "

tripadvisor,spa,1,experience;food;service;convenience;value,"Restaurante italiano muy próximo a Picadilly; cena de sábado por la noche. Sin reserva previa.No hay mucha variedad de platos pero lo que tienen esta bastante bien. En nuestro caso unos calamares fritos de picoteo y luego una pizza prosciutto y unos spaghetti carbonara. Los calamares bastante mejorables, sin embargo la pizza muy buena y los spaghettis perfectos. Algunos platos como los spaghettis los tienen en raciones medianas y completas; os recomiendo la completa ya que las raciones no son demasiado abundantes. Media docena de vinos (a precios de Londres claro); en nuestro caso un digno Montepulcciano a casi 26£ la botella. Cargan un 12,5% por el servicio.Muy simpática la camarera de Getafe, lo que siempre ayuda en tierra extraña."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,food;service,"If your restaurant is all about chicken then at least you would expect the best chicken ever. Beside the original interior( although to avoid on warm days cause it's hot inside due to the lack of aricon this together with the ovens make you feel like getting roasted ), the menu was not very precise. We ordered  a snack mix, chicken nuggets and maize with a dip.  What we received was tasteless fried mix and maize  with sauce all over it. Imagine the face of the kids when they saw sauce on the maize  It said maize  with a DIP . When I made this remark to the waitress she offered to remove the sauce ?!?!? Excuse me ? As far as goes my food knowledge ' a DIP' is always a sauce to DIP your food in else you call it maize  with sauce !  The chicken itself was plain boring chicken I can name much more places in Mechelen were you can eat chicken and at least the piece is bigger.A small breast  is simply unacceptable for  over 9 euro's and that is the price without side dishes but fair is fair a good chicken jus."

My husband enjoyed his breaded chicken and chips. It is very close to theatres.Negatives: my lasagne was slightly burnt on top and concealed go bottom of the dish. There was no meat in it at all (at least, none that I could find). It was basically a cheese and tomato sauce on a sheet of pasta. Nothing like a real Italian lasagne should be and definitely not worth £12.95. There are plenty of other restaurants nearby and several other Italians. I wouldn't go here again."

Would recommend as a snack.

Food was really average I had a pasta dish which should of had asparagus and mine didn’t have any. I also ordered a mini dessert with coffee.  Well it was certainly mini, one very small mouthful.  Coffee Latte was cold and had to be returned with the waitress to be presented with yet another cold latte.The manager did apologise but by then I was not interested in having a coffee.

The only downside was the portion size of the salted caramel brownie, it was 1"" square with a teaspoon of cream, and for £5.65 was extremely overpriced, we should have commented on it but didn't want to embarrass our guests.  Staff were attentive and the restaurant had a good atmosphere."

Our server was a woman who spoke poor English, but that’s fine. She was a little gruff, but that was ok. I had a bowl of bread that was really good, and an excellent aperitif of Prosecco and peach purée. Our dinner came out slowly. My spaghetti with meatballs was excellent. So was my daughter’s.

Ebenfalls die Zubereitung der Speisen (hatten das komplette Frühstück mit Sandwich, Kaffee, O-Saft und Joghurt & die Joghurt-Bowl) brauchte sehr lange, das Personal schien insgesamt wirklich überfordert. Die Qualität des Frühstücks war okay, die Bowl ist aufgrund des Preises aber z.B.: nicht weiterzuempfehlen (eine kleine Schüssel Joghurt mit einer Handvoll Goji-Beeren, Chia-Samen & Äpfeln sind für knappe 7€ einfach zu wenig)! Aufgrund der langen Wartezeiten, der Qualität des Essens stimmt für mich persönlich das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis leider nicht. "

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food,"Obviously a popular restaurant as it was very crowded on friday night - and quite noisy!  We had starters - shared the mushrooms and the prawn cocktail - both good.  The steaks - sirloin and ribeye were all cooked to perfection.  The only irritating thing was this - and it happens in a lot of restaurants.  They gave us the menu, my friend chose Seabass, only to be told not available.  Why was this not mentioned when the menus were given out?  So then she had to re-choose quickly so we were not held up from ordering.  The wine selection was good."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,service;environment,"My partner and I decided to stop for a bite to eat mid afternoon, as we sat down we waited around 15/20 minutes for someone to notice us sat on a table. When I finally grabbed someone’s attention he then snapped at me and told me I was sitting on a “drinks only table” He then noticed I had a bottle of water with little left in it sat on the table next to us. He then started telling me how rude I was bringing my own drinks to the restaurant and then proceeded to tell me I was disrespectful in front of the rest of the restaurant. When I explained i didn’t mean any harm and that the temperature Is Is 33 degrees and very warm and I had the water whilst my partner and I were walking around he told me that in Holland it Is disrespectful and proceeded to then begin to speak his own language, so god knows what he was saying about me. I haven’t had any one say anything to us the entire holiday (6 days) given the warm heat, and obviously I was going to order drinks along side my meal and had no intentions of drinking my half empty - now warm - bottle anyway I feel this was completely out of order and extremely rude and poor customer service. So we got up and left. Don’t waste your money."

I ordered the spicy chorizo tosti but I'm not a fan off the spicy, so they immediately offered to leave it off. My friend ordered an almond milk cappuccino which they don't charge extra for. Lastly, because we were sitting outside and I had an orange juice unfortunately wasps where everywhere. That being said, the staff got rid of them as best as they could without angering them and otherwise offered to move us inside (which they did for other customers too). All in all a positive experience and a lovely lunch! I'd recommend it to everyone!"

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"We were told this place was great so we thought we’d try it out, we ate from the set menu the meals were exactly what you pay for (tiny and not great quality) My boyfriend had a burger that was over cooked and not great I had the goats cheese tart, it was burnt at the bottom and when I told the waitress she took it off my plate with her fingers and took it into the kitchen, leaving me with a few cold chips on my plate before returning about 10 minutes later to collect the rest of the plate, tell me it was the last one and offer me something else (no other vegetarian option available) luckily I just don’t love meat but I can and do eat it so I also had a burger, which wasn’t on the set menu so the whole thing became more expensive 😩 Cocktails were good though that was possibly the only saving grace! Because it was reccomended to us and I also work in the service industry we thought we’d try again as all places have bad days and mistakes are sometimes made.... 2nd visit wasn’t much better, the food wasn’t bad but we waited 45 mins for starters and our mains areived first, we then waited 10 mins for the starters and when the mains were brought back out they had just been under the hot plate! Not impressed and wont be returning By all means try this place the staff on the whole are friendly and the drinks are pretty but the food and overall service isn’t what you expect for the prices you pay!"
tripadvisor,eng,1,environment,"We went for a birthday celebration dinner on Friday, we really enjoyed the wine and the food, but unfortunately for service I cannot say the same. It started okey, waitress did not kept us waiting and she explained how their menu works. We have ordered several plates from the dishes and sides for each person. They have brought first round of dishes but some of the sides were missing. Later on with the second round of dishes they brought the missing sides but we were already full. Also They brought the two dishes at the same time which made one dish to go cold, which really effected the taste. Waitress did not ask if we needed anything and she did not bring the tap water we have asked. At the end they brought ice-cream as a complimentary but they forgot 1 person.  Nevertheless, we have enjoyed Spare Ribs, Mussels, Brill, Langoustine, Steak Tartare. All the dishes were tasty and the ingredient quality is really high. The most loved dish among the all was the ice-cream near the dessert Surprise Egg. It was soo delicious. Also prices are okey when you think this place as a Michelin Star. Overall it was a good experience and good atmosphere with flowers hanging and nice out-door seating, recommended."

tripadvisor,nld,-1,service;environment,"Op een drukke zaterdagavond gereserveerd voor 2 personen. Toen we aankwamen zag je heel veel mensen duidelijk geïrriteerd met niets van drank of eten op hun tafeltje. Ik ging naar de toog en nadat er reeds 4 keer iemand van het personeels mij passeerde zonder zelfs een blik te gunnen werd ik toch aangesproken. We werden een tafel toegewezen buiten. Dit stond nog vol leeggoed van de vorige klanten en nergens  was er ""gereserveerd"" te lezen. Als je het mij vraagt gewoon geluk dat er nog 1 tafeltje vrij was. De vuile glazen en borden werden niet afgeruimd. Als er eens een bestelling naar buiten kwam wist de bediening nooit voor wie deze was en veel klanten werden kwaad. Daarbovenop was de bediening, het leken mij jobstudenten, de hele tijd commentaar aan het geven op elkaar. Luid zodat iedereen het kon horen. Na 5 minuten nog geen kaart ontvangen. 1 grote chaos en er leek niemand iets in handen te nemen. De hele zaak straalde negativiteit en miserie uit.Dan hebben we beslist om op te staan en te vertrekken. Een gezellig avondje uit kreeg een onverwachte wending. Ik vraag mij af hoelang we hier zouden gezeten hebben indien noet vertrokken. Dit leek mij geen momentopname maar eerder iets wat grondig fout zit. Ik geef het alleszins geen kans meer."

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service;environment,"Nice restaurant right near Hyde Park, the staff is efficient, very friendly and ... Italian! Very good cuisine although my penne were a bit overcooked. I had a starter, a main course and a desert plus a bottle of sparkling water for 39£. Italian music playing in the background, nice atmosphere."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service;value,"On arrival for lunch we were handed the menu. Having seen on the web-site that there was a £12.95/£14.95 set lunch option we asked to see that menu. We were told that it wasn't available. That left us to choose two courses off the main menu at a cost nearer £20. Afterwards I contacted the restaurant by e-mail to find out why the set menu was unavailable. The prompt response was that the menu was available, but offering no explanation as to why the staff were 'hiding it'. I guess in the short term it boosts takings, but this restaurant will now be in the sin bin for a while. It is not even as if the food is that special in a crowded segment of the market."

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food;consistency;reputation,"Middleton's Steak House and Grill in Peterborough is brill. Its great location the centre of Queensgate (town), amazing customer service and of course its food is to die for!!My grandad have been coming to Middleton's alot for dinner together and have got to know Kayleigh (one of the managers) and Marta and also the lovely polish lady who is normally occupuing the bar when you walk in (sorry I can't remember her name) they are all really lovely and always make a point of coming over to speak to us even if they aren't serving on that particular day. As soon as we walk into the restaurant we are remembered which is really lovely and all the staff that have served/waitered us have also been lovely and have great customer service. Grandad and I usually go for the set menu which is available from 12-6pm Monday and Friday and 12-5pm Saturday amd Sunday where at £10.95 for a starter, main course and dessert is great value! On all the times we have been coming we can never fault the quality and taste of the food (which is good as elsewhere Grandad has complained about steak but he never has anything bad to say about the steak here) grandad also loves the middletons sundae and knicker bocker glory also and sometimes even has seconds!! We don't have a bad thing or can think of one to say about Middleton's Steakhouse in Peterborough-  the lovely welcoming staff that make you feel valued and at home and the scrumptious food here make us come back again and again and we will be sure to come back very soon! Keep up the good work Kayleigh, Marta and team!! 😁"
tripadvisor,fra,1,food;environment;service,Terrasse sympa dans le centre d'Utrecht. Rien de particulier à noter : bons burgers avec une certaine recherche dans les saveurs et service agréable. Une bonne adresse.
tripadvisor,spa,1,food;environment,Sitio muy agradable. La calle Enrico Granados favorece la terraza por la tranquilidad y el verde al rededor. Buen vino pero comida impersonal. Comida: Aconsejo el MINI-BURGER VASCO 3.50€ (muy mini) y las TOSTADAS un poquito caras pero muy ricas. Nota negativa: LAS BRAVAS NO ESTÁN CRUJIENTES 🥺! Aconsejable por un aperitivo tranquilo 🌳🧘🏼‍♀️🍷

Locatie is perfect: precies in het midden van de winkelstraat tussen de belangrijke bezienswaardigheden van Brugge. Het enige wat naar ons idee tegenviel is bediening. "
tripadvisor,eng,-1,service,"Went there for the second time last weekend, first visit a year ago was o.k., nicely designed, good food and I like the ""the matching beer to every burger""-idea. This time the food was quite good as well but that's it with the positives. We arrived at 6.30, ordered our drinks and our food a few minutes later, got our drinks within another five minutes and the wait began. A long wait. Other guests came, ordered and recieved their food while our wait continued. A party at the table next to us arrived after us and they finished their meal while we were still waiting. After 65 minutes my brother went to the bar and asked about our food. We were told there had been a mistake at the kitchen and we would get our food five minutes later. Five minutes later we got our burgers (I think I got another burger than I ordered but this could have been a misunderstanding, after more than 70 minutes I wasn't sure about my order), minus the onion rings (they would have take another 15 minutes so we didn't want them any more). But the really bad thing wasn't even the delay, it was how it was dealt with. We waited for over an hour and during this time nobody cared to ask if everything was o.k. They didn't even ask if we would like to order another drink, my beer was finished after about 20 minutes. Nobody cared that everybody got their food except us. After it was obvious that they made a mistake, the only person who said ""sorry"" was our young waiter, no manager came to apologize, nothing. First time in my life I didn't tip t a restaurant..."
tripadvisor,por,1,food;experience,Adorei tudo! Desde a entrada à sobremesa. Os pratos são maravilhosos e cheios de sabor. O tempo de espera foi muito reduzido visto quê chegámos muito cedo.Experiência a repetir! 😃

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food,We were looking for somewhere new to eat and thought we would give it a try.We were seated very quickly by a friendly young man. The menu was varied and there was also a cheaper fixed price menu for day time which we didnt go for. Our waitress Hollie was very knowledgeable about the menu and told us about tasting menu they had been given so they could help customers with choices as it gave them an insight into the food. Wish other places would do the same. As my other half likes his meat extremely well done Hollie advised us that it would be a while for our food to come out and would we like some nibbles. I guess the warning is so that after 15 mins people aren't complaining about the fact they don't have their meal. I am of the opinion that if it's good food I don't mind waiting.The food was cooked to perfection my lamb rump was cooked rare and tasted amazing. The other half had mixed grill and all was cooked as requested. The only thing that caused a disagreement was the crushed peas...... I liked them.... he wasn't sure and eventually decided that he didn't like them!Thank you for a great meal and we shall be back!
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food,"I went with a friend for first time Thursday after my teenage son said he really likes it there. Was clean, great service, served by Hollie, who was Lovely. We had the 3 courses set. Was better than expected for the price £10.95. Steak done to perfection! Toilet facilities really clean. Sink in each cubical. Loved the animal pictures outside toilets. Thank you for a lovely meal and Thank You to Hollie. Will definately be going back."
tripadvisor,ita,-1,experience;food;value,"Siamo stati ieri sera a cena in questo ristorante, sperando di poter mangiare pasta dignitosa. Abbiamo preso spaghetti al pomodoro, piatto abbondante, buono il sugo ma la pasta era scotta (probabilmente a causa della precottura, visto che abbiamo ricevuto i piatti a meno di 5 minuti dall'ordine, e non puoi precuocere gli spaghetti!!!). La nota dolente è arrivata con il conto, dove, mio malgrado, ho notato un'aggiunta del 12,5% relativa al servizio... Dopo 6 giorni a Londra è stato l'unico ristorante ad inserire, per un tavolo di 2 persone, direttamente nel conto, il servizio (in Italia se lo sognano). Tra l'altro avrei dato molto più volentieri la mancia ai camerieri, così invece mi sembra molto scorretto. Da non frequentare."
tripadvisor,ita,1,experience,Ambiente molto bello con personale gentile e disponibile.Cocktails ben fatti e materie prime di qualità.Consiglio vivamente la combination di frutti di mare e crostacei grigliati.Da provare ottima rapporto qualità prezzo.

tripadvisor,eng,1,food;environment,Their pork meatball was awesome on a bed of mashed potatoes/veggies! Pairs perfectly with a view and the outdoor dining allows for great people watching and a view of the bourse
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service,Let me start by saying that the restaurant was 3/4 empty on a busy Saturday afternoon so that probably should have told us something. We never actually got into the place to eat as we waited over 5 minutes to be seated. The place was empty and we were ignored at least 3 times by people working there so decided to leave.

tripadvisor,eng,1,food;service,"Chickens must be the most unlucky animals on the planet, as most meat eaters tend to eat chicken from time to time.  We -parents- had the crispy Thai chicken salad. The little one had chicken nuggets. It’s always a pleasure to come and enjoy a family dinner at Poule & Paulette in Mechelen."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;value;food,"We visited Middletons as had been there a year ago and were impressed.  However, this time the food was very disappointing and not cheap.  The portion sizes were poor  (and I am not a big eater) and the food lukewarm. The only reason we did not complain was as it had been chosen by a family member for a celebration and we did not want to make a scene."
tripadvisor,deu,1,service;food,"Entgegen der anderen Meinungen hatten wir eine kurze Wartezeit und das bei sieben Personen am Tisch. Die Burger sind in Ordnung. Sehr gut ist, dass ein Beyond Meat Burger angeboten wird. Schade, dass bei jedem Burger automatisch eine Beilage dabei ist. Wäre schön, wenn man darauf verzichten könnte. "

I arrived on time for my booking to arrive to a queue of people all waiting to served. Four couples where offered a table right by the kitchen with a pillar right by the side of it meaning u had to sit next to each. Not opposite as most couples want. So they all turned down the table and left. When we where finally served I said I had reserved a table and they didn't say anything and just pointed to the same table they had just offered to the 4 other couples. I asked if there was another table to which they replied ""no"" the waitress said "" if u dont like it leave"". When I said I had booked a table. She replied this us the one reserved for us, which it clearly wasnt. I left and went to a properly tun restaurant round the corner. Want to book go somewhere else. Terrible service, staff where rude and a horrible atmosphere."

Helaas gesloten, nou ja ze konden nog wel een burger maken als ik hem mee zou nemen.  Dat ook gedaan, op hotel kamer hem op gegeten.  Ik had de classic burger, nou klassiek was ie zeker niet ondanks dat ik te laat was ( ze waren al dicht) een verse heerlijke burger.  Zoals ze wel zeggen smaakt naar meer.

Het eerste probleem was dat wij niet konden reserveren.Toch even gewacht, ondanks dat de medewerker zei dat het een uur ging duren. Na 10 min hadden wij 2 aparte tafels.Het restaurant was afgeladen vol en het personeel kon dat niet aan omdat zij onderbemand waren.Onze bestelling liet heel lang op zich wachten, er was amper bediening en de bestelling was ook een paar keer foutief.Bavetten werden niet aangeboden. We konden amper een drankje bestellen door de drukte.Online bestellingen werden sneller meegegeven dan dat mensen in de zaal bediend werden.De ""beleving"" was ver te zoeken...Het was voor onze vrienden de eerste keer, maar ik denk niet dat zij nog terugkomen.Jammer."

It was the first time I have tried a frozen Cappuccino (that is not the very sweet frozen coffee-things from Starbucks) and it was so delicious :)Also the staff was friendly and the location is perfect, as it is right next to the beach.You could see that they really know what they are doing, books of latte art and roasted coffee to buy. It is quite pricy, but it was totally worth the price !"

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;food,"We arrived when the restaurant was in the process of filling up. The interior looks fresh, the vibe is cool and the seafood on display looks incredibly appetizing. After being shown to our table however our problems started. It seems like nearly every time we got served or needed something, a different person came to the table. Not per se an issue if they would talk to eachother...My partner asked for an alcohol free cocktail, and instead got served the same cocktail but WITH alcohol. Major mistake. We returned it, they came back to say they weren't sure about the first one so they'd make a new one, but we were then forgotten about and I had to go ask for our drink again 15 minutes into already having our meal. The other drink was a sweet white wine, we got the red instead even though we clearly didn't ask for it. This was also exchanged, but we still got billed for the red one instead.The service errors became frustrating, and in the end we just wanted to get out of there. Some of the mistakes made were inexcusable.Shame, cause the food was actually delicious."
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service,Our visit this time was to celebrate a family members 80th Birthday. The mixed grill  and desserts were delicious. The restaurant was very busy but we received excellent service from Hollie. Looking forward to visiting again soon.
tripadvisor,eng,1,value;innovation;food,"High prices with average food. Not really fresh ingredients for the food (many sauces are obviously from a can or long premade and/or mixed with mayonaise). It looks much better on the menu than in reality. For example, we order a veggie burger with mozarella and pesto, just to discover that it was not real pesto but some mayonaise with pesto dressing. On the positive side, they have good beers with a nice selection and a recommendation on which beer goes best with each burger. "
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food,Me and the husband decided to come and try out middletons and omg why haven’t we been before !! The meal was fantastic the steak was the best I’ve ever tasted melted in your mouth. We will definitely be coming back. 
tripadvisor,eng,1,food;environment;service,"This Korenmarkt really offers all catering possibilities: from MacDonald's over Ellis Gourmet Burger to Du Progrès Restaurant. Poule et Poulette is an original concept somewhere in between. I liked the classic half chicken with fries, while my table companions loved the nachos. Friendly service. Only the house wine is amenable to improvement."

tripadvisor,deu,-1,experience;service;value,"Das Restaurant macht von außen einen sehr lebendigen Eindruck, da immer eine Wartezeit und jeder Tisch besetzt ist. Leider war die seafood Platte kalt und nicht das was wir für den Preis erwartet hätten. Das Ambiente kommt einer Bahnhofshalle gleich genauso wie der Service, der dem Preis einfach nicht gerecht wird. Würde das Restaurant auf keinen Fall weiterempfehlen, es war mit Abstand das Schlechteste essen in unserem Amsterdam Urlaub! "

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"The pub is in a nice location and lots of parking. On arrival we had to wait a short while to get seated, which was fine. It became clear that there wasn’t enough staff as every table had not been cleared and we waited 20 minutes after sitting down and then had to track someone down to get some drinks and order my childrens food. We had water brought to the table but no glasses, so we had to ask. When food arrived, no cutlery. I had seafood platter which was nice (pic attached) but over priced. My wife had surf n turf. Prawns were not Peri Peri and over cooked. Childrens burgers were over cooked but fish fingers were nice. 3 stars only given as ‘Chris’, who I think was the manager, was very calm under pressure and apologetic. Every table around us were compensated in some way for the issues they had, but well done that man for keeping it together and some damage limitation implemented.Sadly, too bad to risk returning again. "
tripadvisor,eng,1,service;environment;food;value,"This is really a good formula. Spaghetti in a nice way, bolognaise, Cheese sauce, meatballs, vegans balls, bacon, chicken, spicy, not spicy, extra cheese, and so on...For a correct price in a nice setting. Great choice of Belgian better beers like la Chouffe and Vedette IPA. No cash only credit cards. So tax wise, an honest restaurant. An example for the industry. I recommend fully if you want a nice quality pasta and no fuss. "
tripadvisor,nld,1,food;environment;service,"Heel leuk concept, heel leuk ingericht. Het eten is lekker en personeel heel vriendelijk. Door de open ruimte heb je wel snel het gevoel dat het druk en wat chaotisch is.

Elle est obligée de prendre son téléphone pour faire une division par 2. Elle donne des chaussures bien trop petites alors que la bonne taille lui est demander. Les tarifs sont élevé quand on voit les pistes qui ne sont pas droites, il n’y a que quelques tailles de boules. Et pour en revenir à la serveuse. Nous sommes aller commander à boire des notre arrivée, à la fin des 2 parties de bowling soit approximativement 1 heure, toujours rien, en même temps compliqué de servir les clients quand on passe son temps sur son téléphone.

They have minimum tables set aside for reservations and were unable to get one but they were able to seat us quickly.  The mixed seafood grill was absolutely delicious.  We ordered it for two with a side of salad and fries.  This was plenty of food for the two of us.  It included lobster, shrimp, mussels, prawns, scallops, dover sole, sea bass.

Great bright spot. Give it a try for sure.

tripadvisor,eng,0,food;service,This restaurant could be fantastic.Wide selection of beers and great interesting  burgers really well cooked let down by slow and uninterested service.it seemed to us that the waiting staff just saw us as a number to get seated and deliver to with no warmth or sense of personalised care.We booked and were told out table wasnt ready and were shown to an empty table to wait.after 30 mins of no communication or opportunity to order a drink we managed to get a waiters attention.after about 45 mins it was decided that we could order and remain at this table.after about 75 mins we got our order but there was never any sign of polite apology or acknowledge ment of the multiple delays.I'm sure with some basic training the front of house team could match the standards in the kitchen
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;value;service,"Went here for my anniversary the other day, and was very impressed.Steakhouses have a tendency to overcharge in the quest for a fancy dining experience, but Middletons offers a 10z rump steak for about £18 and that includes a side of your choosing. It would've sweetened the deal even more if the sauce was included, but I can forgive that.For an idea of a meal price, we both had starters, steak and shared a £25 bottle of wine and the entire bill came to £73. Not bad at all.The steak was lovely as was my starter (garlic mushrooms), they had a very comprehensive selection of wines and the service was rock solid. Barely had to wait any time at all for the food to arrive (admittedly this was a very quiet Monday).Decor is relatively no-frills if that's your thing; tidy but fairly unremarkable. But where it mattered most, Middletons delivers affordable steak dining, which there's a curious lack of in Chelmsford town center."

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service,"Four of us had dinner here recently - we shared some of the seafood platters so that we could try different things.  All of the food was excellent.  Especially the fried fish, the king crab legs, and the clams.  The restaurant was completely full - so it is advisable to have a reservation unless you want to wait an hour for a table.  Service was spotty.  But that did not detract from a very enjoyable meal."

What the hell is going on in their minds? They just give you the bill including the exorbitant tip, with no option to remove it, We was there celebrating a special occasion, so I did not want to embarrass my partner, but rang head office the following morning to tell them of my disgust at their inclusive tipping, and guess what? They had the audacity to put me through to the big Russian guy, who’d served us, fortunately I’ve got plenty of grit, and told him to remove the £9.50 from my already paid bill, after a lengthy discussion he said he would have this amount put back on my card, and it was completed satisfactorily. But be careful if your of a timid nature?"

This time an Indonesian style cuisine. We visited for my son’s birthday on a Sunday evening. An elevator from the ally brings you to the top floor. The kitchen is in the middle under the arched roof, with tables around it all looking very nice.The food on the other hand was really good. We took the ‘rijst tafel’, all the dishes served in small portions. Also a choice for veggies. We eat quite a lot of Indonesian food but this is at the high end. Service is good. Sunday live music was a bit too loud for our taste, perhaps check beforehand if that is not your thing. Otherwise Hudson’s Bay is leaving so hopefully Ron’s can stay. "

At first we sat on the street to enjoy the street scene, but when the shower started, we asked the lady if we could go inside. And without hesitation, she helps us reload a table in a restaurant. We had a seafood day soup with mussels and fish, fried fish, fried fish and a selection of snacks with herring and other things. Everything was exceptionally fresh and tasty. The spice was perfect without compromising the freshness of the seafood. It definitely set the tone for our entire trip to Amsterdam."

This large airy restaurant has an outdoor covered terrace. Kricket is usually Anglo-Indian but last night they had a special Anglo Thai Chef Series for September. We started off with a Thainapple Express gin cocktail so good we had a couple more. There was a set dinner starting with BhelnPuri with a caramel fish sauce very moorish and delightfully crunchy. Followed by a Lemongrass Tandoor chicken with mint yoghurt and tamarind, a wild mushroom and Buckthorn Nam followed along with a red curry fish cake with a cucumber sauce. Next course was wild boar curry with pickled gRlic and crispy shallots with pickled red onion sweet yoghurt and turmeric rice. Pudding was a coconut rice pudding with blackberries and butterfly sorrel leaves. We drank a Godello from Galicia and finished with some fresh mint tea. The flavours in this exeptional meal were remarkable, so interesting and intense. I am a great fan of Kricket and enjoy going to their other two restaurants in Denman Street off Shaftesbury Avenue and Brixton. All are well worth a visit White branch is truly delightful."

We chose the location because of the outdoor seating, but were disheartened to find a rowdy pub next door which created a horrendous level of noise. We ordered a £26 Pinot Grigio which was revolting - tasted like nail varnish remover - and came in a warm bottle cooler with no ice. The spaghetti itself was so greasy we felt too bloated to go to a bar or anything afterwards and went home with severe tummy troubles. The people on the table next to us had to send back their pizza because it was stone cold. And all this for over £100. Huge waste of money, avoid at all costs."

We ordered drinks and they came promptly but nobody came to take our food order for  ages. People that came after us were already having their food and we hadn’t even had our orders taken!Another thing that we didn’t like was that for other people the staff brought some bread and snacks ‘while they were waiting’ on the house and we didn’t get any! We simply were ignored.When the food came it was good and plentiful but the staff were quite disoriented and we got a different server each time. The shellfish was fresh and well prepared but we were quite disappointed with the service. I would avoid this place at peak times.

We were sat at the front of the restaurant , the tables are small and cramped . We ordered our food and the starters arrived very quickly , and so did the main course ! This arrived before we were even half way through eating the starters. They tried to place the mains on the table and I pointed out that surely they can see we haven’t finished and were not ready . I asked for the mains to be taken away and had asked For them not to be  placed under the heat lamp  as this would dry out the pasta and burger we had ordered, to this I got told we are very busy and it cannot be helped  . I fully understand as it was pre theatre dining time , but surely a nightly occurrence being so close to two theatres.  We finished our starters and as the plates were cleared the mains were waiting In the wings !  Needless to say both dishes were cold & dry . The dishes were replaced with fresh but with no apology . Sitting on the table up against the bar area meant that any raised voices behind the bar can be overheard! And the young lady behind the bar should not be chewing gum it didn’t look professional ."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;food;value,"Truly one of the worst meals I've ever had the pleasure of paying for.Fried mozzarella for a starter - lukewarm mozzarella balls that were visibly leaking onto the plate, presumably the water from the cheese. Unappetising to say the least.Pizza with grease visible pooling in its crevices - it should be necessary to dab down your food before you eat it.They got one order wrong, and forgot to bring drinks on occasion - ordered water for the table at the start of the meal and it didn't materialize. From being seated to recieving our drinks took over half an hour.Over £30 per head, which isn't expensive but is not at all commensurate with the food.Will not be returning."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"I am very sorry to have to write this review, following writing an excellent review for last Mother's Day.  We returned to Middletons for a birthday lunch, with high expectations, however, when our meals arrived, we were very disappointed to say the least  The 'roast beef' was not roast beef at all, but pan fried minute steak, which was so tough it was completely inedible.  To make matters worse, all of our meals were almost stone cold, so they all had to be returned to the kitchen.  We want to point out that this problem had nothing to do with the waiting staff, who were doing their best in the circumstances and absolutely fantastic as always.  When leaving, we were offered a discount off our total bill, which we were very grateful for, however, we feel that this level of food service from the kitchen is unacceptable."

tripadvisor,ita,-1,experience;service,"Peccato.... eravamo stati al Seafood bar altre volte in passato e ci eravamo sempre trovati benissimo per il cibo ma anche per il  servizio cortese ed efficiente.Ma questa volta il servizio è stato allucinante, forse solo una serata sfortunata ma non vorrei che ingrandirsi troppo (siamo arrivati a 4 sedi) abbia portato ad uno scadimento del servizio. Già un anno fa nella nostra ultima visita (in questo caso nella sede di Baerlestraat ) avevamo avuto problemi: nonostante la prenotazione ed essere arrivati in orario, avevamo dovuto attendere quasi mezz'ora il tavolo.Ma questa volta è stato il massimo: ordiniamo un piatto con 12 ostriche, come antipasto ed a seguire un plateau per mia moglie ed un fish and chips per me, inoltre avvertiamo che mia moglie è allergica all'uovo ed alla maionese (ovviamente), quindi chiediamo di avere il plateau di mia moglie senza uovo o salse.Bene arriva prima il mio fish and chips e contemporaneamente le ostriche! Abbiamo detto al cameriere che avevamo chiesto le ostriche come antipasto e ci risponde che loro portano sempre tutto insieme.... (non  è vero ) vista la mia faccia, portano via il fish and chips (che chiaramente si sarebbe raffreddato mangiando prima le ostriche) e mangiamo le ostriche, davvero ottime, come al solito.Finite le ostriche dopo poco ci portano i due piatti principali, guardando quello di mia moglie notiamo che c'è anche dell'insalata di granchio con dentro maionese!Avvertiamo la cameriera che aveva preso l'ordinazione e l'avvertimento dell'allergia all'uovo, gli chiediamo conferma che nel granchio c'era l'uovo, verifica, torna, conferma e porta via il piatto... Dopo un pò arriva un altro cameriere con il piatto di mia moglie: incredibile non  solo c'è ancora il granchio ma anche una ciotolina con una salsa cocktail, ovviamente con la maionese!! Ennesima rimostranza, cameriera con faccia sconvolta, e finalmente  ci riportano il piatto senza uovo.Tutto ciò è gravissimo, se ci fossimo fidati e non avessimo controllato (una salsa è più difficile da notare di un uovo intero) mia moglie sarebbe all'ospedale! Con le allergie non si scherza ci sono persone che possono morire per queste disattenzioni.Inoltre credo che non si siano nemmeno resi conto della gravità... un responsabile poteva venire a scusarsi o a dare spiegazioni, non si è visto nessuno, se non la cameriera che confabulava con (credo) il capo sala, ma da noi non è venuto nessuno.Il livello del cibo è sempre buono, ma il servizio è inaccettabile.E non mi si obbietti che dovevamo dirlo al momento, la cameriera era al corrente di tutto, non è mia abitudine dare in escandescenze a ristorante, non si sono nemmeno scusati, semplicemente non torneremo più."

The large light assembly is really dusty as are the small lights and supports above the tables.  This really needs taking care of as dust and dirt could fall into the food."

tripadvisor,nld,-1,service;environment;food,"Zaterdagavond gaan eten. Ik ben fan maar mijn vrouw kende gourmet burger nog niet. Gewoonlijk ga ik naar die aan het MAS maar we moesten toevallig in de Elisabethzaal zijn voor een voorstelling.De bediening was zeer vriendelijk en ze kwamen vrij snel onze bestelling opnemen. Na een 10 minuutjes kwam de serveerster terug aan onze tafel om onze bestelling opnieuw op te nemen (op papier) omdat haar PDA/GSM niet meer werkte.Wij hadden hier uiteraard begrip voor.Een kwartier later nog steeds geen drinken gezien (en scheurende honger) en onze tijd begon al weg te tikken. Gevraagd of we ons drinken misschien al konden krijgen waarop er blijkbaar wat paniek ontstond en er WEER iemand onze bestelling op kwam nemen. Blijkbaar was ons papiertje verloren geraakt.Goed, nog steeds geduldig blijven zitten. We hadden expliciet gevraagd of we nog op tijd ons eten gingen krijgen aangezien we intussen een uur later in de zaal moesten zijn. Dit ging geen probleem zijn.Na 15 min weer geen drinken of voorgerecht (pintje, hibiscus lemonade, calamares en onion rings, lijkt me niet moeilijk om even snel te frituren). Intussen hadden klanten die lang na ons waren aangekomen al lang voorgerechten en drinken gekregen. Hierop waren we het echt wel beu en zijn we nog even vriendelijk gaan melden dat het niet meer nodig was gezien ons tijdsgebrek. Er was duidelijk onbegrip voor, wat voor ons dan weer niet echt door de beugel kon. Als zij 3 keer moeten komen opnemen, dan gaan wij er ergens van uit dan onze bestelling naar voor geschoven wordt, al was het maar onze drank en voorgerechten. We hebben dan maar in de buurt snel een hamburger uit het vuistje genomen. Zeer spijtig want jullie hamburgers zijn geweldig.Jullie zaak op de Keyserlei zal ik alleszins vermijden vanaf nu want het bracht enorme frustratie mee. "

tripadvisor,eng,1,service;experience;environment,"We were delayed and had to wait at the bar. Tried to get a drink but a non responsive bar tender, busy being busy. Start with very poor champagne, watered down gin tonic with a slice of lemon and kumquat. Poor cocktail. Starter decent dim sum taster, nothing outstanding. Main I had soft crab which was excellent, singapore noodles overcooked. Wine, SA sauvignon blanc, good and cold. Order second round dim sum as main was small portion. Interior the usual modern black, not my style, kitsch artwork on walls. Staff friendly. 180 Euro for 2. In order to be on an international level, like Hakkasan or Nobu, more steps are needed. "

The waitress admitted to forgetting to put my order in, then tried to charge me full price for the meal when I finally got the bill. A shrimp and mango salad shouldn’t have taken an hour to make. And after all this, it wasn’t very nice. Far too oily, which detracted a lot from the flavours. I don’t think I’ll be going back. "

Had the crab legs, mixed grill, lobster soup, salad, and fries. Mixed grill impressive and tasty. Crab legs were good but not as good as Alaskan King Crab. Lobster soup was a broth not a bisque. Fries were very good and the salad was very average.Would like to return to try other menu items."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;food,"We went to Middletons for a works meal (9 people) on Saturday evening, the table was booked for 8pm and we ended up leaving after the mains at around 10:30pm. I think we ordered around 8:30pm and starters arrived about 40 minutes later so it's not one for a quick visit! Starters were ok and the mains were really good, drinks menu is a bit limited but the cocktails were good.The standout from the night though was the waitress Kayleigh R, considering most of the group didn't have starters so were getting a bit impatient by the time mains arrived, she was an absolute star! She advised that the kitchen was really busy so food would be a bit slow as soon as we sat down, she made sure she was always around to get drinks and give us updates on the progress. She managed the evening with a smile and a bit of a laugh along the way, kept everyone's spirits up and we left having had a really good night. Great energy and she was the biggest reason that the night went off smoothly without any complaints about the delays."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"Food, service and wine not as good as expected.My 10oz ribeye was not very tasty, rare when medium to rare ordered and I just can’t see how it had ever been 10 oz bearing in mind it came out rare. The peppercorn sauce was very bland and I think the worse I’ve had. The bottle (£25) of Dona Paula Malbec was in my opinion weak and not like the Malbec’s I’ve previously had but maybe that’s how this one is. The sirloins served to two others were mixed up as to size and how cooked. The fourth persons order was completely wrong . The drinks waiter actually asked us if we wanted glasses when he plonked the bottle on the table! All took some time as well. Manager took off something for the wrong order and wine , we didn’t mention anything else. It was still expensive for what it was and I’ve had far better steak meals elsewhere, so doubt will return. Nice building though! "

When we came back after the theater, inexplicably, the guy didn’t recognize us and told us it was closed. Was bad and We don’t understood why on Saturday night you close earlier..."

Total bill for five people with wine, drinks and dessert came to EUR 170, which is very reasonable for Amsterdam.The food quality is great and the portions are generous. The staff are very friendly and responsive. My only quibble was that my clothes smelled oily and greasy afterwards, which is probably a result of the open kitchen.But it would not stop me from returning and enjoying another meal here in the future. Definitely a place to visit if you enjoy seafood of all varieties."

One time we did whole john dory and another the sea bass.  Excellent price points on the wine and champagne by the bottle and full bar with great bartenders.  HIGHLY recommend this place and I already miss it.  If I lived in Amsterdam this would be my local haunt!"

Awesome selection of high quality fresh seafood and shellfish. The cold platters and seafood towers are impressive. Portions are generous and you will not leave feeling hungry. Very good value by Amsterdam standards. Lobster bisque had plenty of real lobster meat in a creamless, but still rich, broth. Octopus appetizer is excellent and enough to share. Fried mixed platter was very good, although ""Amsterdam Shrimp"" were an odd choice. Only disappointment was the Mussels  -did not live up to menu description - eventually rectified with addition of drawn butter. All in all a good choice for business or date night dinner. "

Voor een hamburger van meer dan 10 euro verwacht je toch dat de hamburger zelf minstens de grootte heeft van 3/4 van het broodje, wat al niet veel is. Ik denk dat het net de helft was. Daar lag dan 1 dom kerstomaatje en een stukje augurk bij op het bord. Belachelijk.De frieten van 3,70 euro (!!) waren hard en koud.Bij het afrekenen heb ik dan zelf ook nog mijn wisselgeld moeten vragen want dat waren ze ‘vergeten’.

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;consistency;food;service,"This restaurant is almost a hidden gem.  At the end of a row of restaurants, it could easily be missed, but it's definately not one to be walked past.  We've eaten here several times, and the food is consistently good.  Their meat is delivered from Norfolk from their own butchers, and everything is made in-house too - all the sauces, marinades, desserts etc and you really can 'taste the difference' to coin a phrase!!!We both had the spicy bbq ribs to start which were juicy and tender, followed by fillet steak for me and a ribeye steak for my husband.  Both steaks had the most delicious flavour - but mine more so! We chose peppercorn sauce and blue cheese sauce to accompany our steaks - delish! The dishes always have a choice of sides too which is unusual in most steak houses.  There's more than steak here though, there's chicken, fish, mussels and the most amazing handmade burgers too.  There's also a fabulous set lunch which is incredible value.  The choice of wines here is good and we always have the house Portuguese rosé which is good and great value.  There's a good range of cocktails too.  Staff here are lovely - all knowledgeable and very friendly.  If you want fabulous food, all cooked to order, this is your place!

Ordered a 12oz steak the person I was with had an 8oz steak and there was no difference at all. Sides were over priced. Customer service was ok apart from no one coming back to the table so we were left with one drink for the whole meal. Wouldn’t recommend and wouldn’t go back.

Very popular destination as it was packed when we arrived and never really relented throughout the evening.The staff are very nice too. Helpful and pleasant. All steaks were great. I had to send mine back as it was a little cold when it arrived however it was remedied and everything was good afterwards. The way my steak, being returned, was dealt with was very reassuring and professional. This is an excellent restaurant. Very reasonable prices too.The only thing I had an issue with was that our server, who was excellent, was, I discovered, on one of these shifts as a try out for the job. She was excellent but she was working unpaid. I find this extremely unfair and exploitative actually. I hope they gave her the job. The restaurant however is Great! Highly recommended "

They were all the right amount of attentive without being intrusive and they all appeared to be 'on it' when it came to general tidying up and turning tables around. A very hard-working team and one of the best evening's customer service we've had in a long time. We never write restaurant reviews but this team have truly deserved this one. The customer service was too good to ignore.

El maridaje lo puso un Chardonnay de Domaine Fevre Nathalie & Guilles, de la región de Chablis, un excelente acompañamiento a tan ricos manjares.El precio para dos personas fue de 118,50 euros, una buena relación calidad precio para el producto que ofrecen.Dada la magnifica experiencia en nuestra primera noche, decidimos que visitaríamos los otros dos establecimientos en Ferdinand Bolstraat y Van Baerlestraat en nuestro recorrido por la ciudad.

So I was expecting quick service, but when our starters arrived literally a couple of minutes after ordering, I was worried we were going to be rushed along too much. Happily the service for the rest of the evening was prompt but not too rushed, and our server was happy to go away & come back a bit later when we were choosing desserts. There seemed to be a lot of waiting staff compared to last time we visited.We enjoyed the food, but I didn't think it was quite as good as on previous visits -flavours for the steaks & ribs were really good as ever, but my piri piri prawns were a bit dry, the mixed grill had little broken pieces of rib bone & the sweet potato fries were rather greasy, as was one of our steaks. Nothing which made us feel like they should be returned, but it just wasn't quite as good as it has been. Hopefully a one off."

Ikzelf had de kippen filet en die was heel lekker, goed van textuur en smaak. Niet zoals die industriële kip vanuit de winkels.

Professioneel, aangenaam, vriendelijk en niet pusherig....wat ideaal was voor ons diner. Zeker het compliment doorgeven aan jullie Team.Ik kom zeker terug!"

tripadvisor,eng,-1,value;food;service,"Food was not the best I’ve had considering the price, I had the 8oz sirloin which only comes with a mushroom and half a grilled tomato,you had to pay extra for your chips in Which you only got french fries in a little pot at an very high cost, they wouldn’t have even filled my 2 year old grandson..the rest had the Sunday lunch which I thought was expensive for a Sunday lunch, you got 1 peace of meat,Yorkshire,3 quarters of a roast potato and 3 veg, I go out for meals a lot and thought was very expensive for all, then on the bill they even add 10% service charge which I think is disgusting, if you want to leave a tip for the service then should be up to the persons paying.which I was going to give £6 tip but I payed what they charged. Also drinks were very dear as well £12 for a large wine and a bottle of budvar not budwiser went around corner after and got a pint and large wine for £7. Well I will not go again unless I really was forced.but the staff we’re very nice and polite."

I had the French fish  soup , the seafood starter platter and and fries and a small salad. It was more then enough and the platter was phenomenal. Clams, muscles, razor clams, croquettes, calamari, fired fish... it was huge and was $29 and could be $39 and I wouldn't have flinched. The soup was a deep bisque with fish, shrimp and a a crostini and some creme. The platters and dishes being sent out were amazing and the staff were all great and responsive to me even though I was solo at the bar. I would highly recommend going here while in Amsterdam."

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience,It’s a large restaurant so you don’t feel crowded at your table. The service was first class and there is a very large selection of seafood to choose from. We both had the basic fish and chips which was very good and quite reasonably priced. The seafood platter was served to people at the next table. It was expensive but huge and looked good.
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service;environment;reputation;value;consistency,I was a single visitor had booked a table and was made to feel welcome. Slightly slow in service although I did arrive early in the evening - 6.30 - but not a problem for me at all. My waiter was attentive and recommended a lovely red wine for me. The waitresses also kept an eye out for me if I needed anything else. The ambience was friendly and relaxing. Food was superb - I enjoyed each course - my Veal main course was extremely good and extremely large too ! I first came here just over 40 years ago and then used to come weekly with my late husband in the 90's - so a lovely memory to come back now - and I thoroughly enjoyed it and will return when next in London

Народу  было много, минут 30ть пришлось подождать, но ожидание явно того стоило, тем более пока ждали наблюдали за персоналом, который подготавливал блюда к подаче. Когда принесли 2х этажную тарелку мы немного обалдели от количества и разнообразия морепродуктов на двоих. Рыба на гриле, мидии в томатном соусе, устрицы, омар, лангуст, крабы, креветки..

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service,"The food and wine was great! Service wise, last time the guy said he would check for a table and 15 minuted later he came back and forgot about us so we just left. Another time the food took like 50 minutes after ordering. This time I only went because my friend insisted, and now the food was quick, but it looked like 3 people were waiters for our table. We ordered food and two times after were asked ro order, same with drinks, and the waiter kept forgetting what we ordered."

The menu indicated that the wrap included guacomole, salsa, and spicy mayo. There was not a hint of any of these three. I had to ask for them separately and only got the latter two. The wrap was something basic I could've made it home - it mainly consisted of rice and beans. On top of all of this, the staff were not friendly or welcoming. I will be visiting other restaurants next time."

She said her waiter was rude to her. That's nonsense. She and her friend were already in a bad mood when they arrived & simply vented their mood on Freddy, our waiter. He did nothing to offend her - in fact I found him very attentive and pleasant to deal with. The food was excellent, the pasta cooked to perfection. So many Italian restaurants simply load on the garlic but such was not the case at the Spaghetti House. Everything was seasoned perfectly and I found the prices very reasonable. The desserts were perfect sized portions and the latte was also well prepared. Overall a very pleasant 5 star experience - with the possible exception of those rude ladies disrupting our lovely meal, threatening the manager with a negative review!"

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,"This was my second visit to Middletons. The food was very tasty but on both occasions service was very slow. We had to ‘flag down’ someone to take our starter and main course order and although we were asked if we would like to see the dessert menus, these were not forthcoming so we eventually just asked for our bill. Staff were friendly enough but they could just do with more of them. Once ordered, the food came quickly but on a relatively quiet Thursday night that would be expected. We will go back as location and food great but not sure how many more chances we will give this place."

A cheese toast can be brought to the level of beautiful simplicity, were you to find a top notch artisan cheese and sourdough bread.

However the fried calamari was just so-so, go with Fritto Misto instead. It’s a mixed fried shrimp, fish and squid with different batter which was really tasty. I love the delicious tendered Razor Clams. And the Mixed Grilled was very flavorful with fishes, shrimps and shellfish. We enjoyed our meal and definitely recommend this place. "

La pizza superfina, estaba rica, pero como he dicho antes, muy básica. El helado de chocolate muy rico, pero no deja de ser una bola de helado. Todo por 11,50€, me pareció caro. No subo fotos porque la pizza daba lástima a la vista."

tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;food;value,"Whilst some of the dishes served were OK others were rather bland. The wine was rather expensive, even by the carafe. Also, because the table we were given had a large knot hole in the surface, a glass of wine was spilt all over one of our group. I suggest the table is replaced."
tripadvisor,eng,-1,experience;service;value;food,"Popped in on Sunday for a roast. This was my first time and I'd heard great things so was excited to visit.On arrival the restaurant we were asked to wait at the bar for drinks for 15 mins so a table could be prepared. We waited for 10 mins before any acknowledgement for drinks and a further 5 after that, but alas no drinks before we were seated.A waitress took our drinks order and delivered 2 bottles of water, but no glasses. We requested glasses and after 5-10 mins for waiting for these we went to the bar and got some ourselves from the waiter behind the bar. We could also see our drinks order sitting at the bar undelivered for a good 5 mins. We ordered food and it came, looking good. Unfortunately we had no cutlery, we had to ask for some and waited some minutes for it (pretty sure the customer should not have to ask for cutlery..). We also had to query if we'd been given enough vegetables for 4 (we received 1 tray with the same amount as a table for 2). With a puzzled look, the waitress delivered us some more/the correct amount. One of the party had ordered the nut roast and realised that instead, without being informed, was given 2 unappealing vegetable burgers. On querying this, the waitress found out they'd run out and hadn't thought to ask or inform us.2 different waitresses then asked us if we wanted dessert menus and whilst waiting for desserts, one had to ask if we'd had them yet or not. We hadn't.So in short, the service was absolute calamatous. The staff were lovely but shouldn't need to apologise everytime they came to the table! The food was good (apart from the nutroast debacle). Seems like something went wrong at management level yesterday! "
tripadvisor,bul,1,experience;service;food,"Нашли этот ресторан в путеводителе ViaMichelin. Ресторан расположен в центре Амстердама, что обычно, настораживает: бесконечные туристические потоки, очереди перед входом ""расслабляют"" сервис и кухню, Действительно, попасть в ресторан без предварительного резерва очень сложно. Но, оказавшись за столиком, становится понятно, что ожидание не напрасно, сервис на высшем уровне, а кухня - широкий выбор: крабы, устрицы, креветки, омары, рыба - выше всяких похвал! Надеюсь, Вы не разочаруетесь! P.S. mixed grill на 2 персоны достаточно и на троих!)"

Our waitress Marta was an attentive host and very friendly. All the staff were polite and helpful. My daughter who is 5 had a great time and enjoyed her food. We ate from the fixed special menu and all of the dishes were of a high standard. The kids menu had big portions enough for two small kids to share and the banana split went down well. I highly recommend a visit.

tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;service;food;reputation,"WE are in Amsterdam for the last layover before leaving for the States tomorrow morning.  Our Consierge recommended The Seafood Bar, which is about a 10 minute walk from our hotel.We hit the restaurant at exactly the right time -- before the crowds --we were seated immediately and had the most incredible meal.  I ordered the Asian stye mussels and my husband ordered the Fruits de Mer -- my dish was definitely the hit.  The sauce was a lemongrass, ginger and coconut -- and was superb!!  The icing on the cake for us was our waitress/hostess, Valeria Spataro, a 2nd year university student in Management at the University of Amsterdam -she recommended the perfect wine for the mussels,- and made multiple recommendations as to the best methods for eating both the mussels and the more varied dishes on my husband's menu.  She also mentioned that she makes a wonderful tea, which we didn't try.   Valeria really enhanced our dinner -- and when we come back to Amsterdam, we hope to see her again.Great restaurant -- huge portions.  If you're in the mood for the great seafood, this is the place to go!"

Passando em frente ao Ellis, o lugar simples e aconchegante me chamou a atenção, especialmente pela vista: esquina de um dos canais. As mesinhas com guarda sol estavam espalhadas sobre a calçada, embaixo de uma enorme árvore, ambiente tranquilo e relaxante. Pedimos alguns pratos típicos da região, todos muito saborosos, mas o campeão foi o BITTERBALLEN (croquete holandês). Nunca comi um bolinho frito tão delicioso na minha vida! Massa extremamente leve, com sabor muito agradável, uma combinação perfeita."

When we decided that maybe we were supposed to seat ourselves, after standing there for a while, another server(?) came out and acknowledged us and gave us some menus but never returned. All this while two other servers walked passed our table for another 10 mins.( they each had one table) We left. It was ridiculous. "

Het voorgerecht, de nachos, waren helaas niet warm en voorzien van een erg vloeibare kaas. Helaas niet zoals verwacht. Daarna een lekkere hamburger gehad (vegan), welke royaal was belegd. Echter, de medewerkers waren niet gastvrij, het duurde enige tijd voordat we werden geholpen en de prijs-kwaliteit verhouding kan beter.

The spaghetti pesto was inedible due to it being drowned in so much pesto, my husband had to order a pizza as he could not eat the pasta and pesto. NO OFFER OF ANY COMPENSATION EVEN THIUGH WE SAID IT WAS INEDIBLE.There was a 12.5% service charge added to a bill which was not described as discretionary.Left feeling very very unhappy and will not be returning"
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience,This place is very busy -especially between 7pm to 9pm. So reservations highly recommended.If you arrive without a reservation you can wait in the front/bar area and outside where drinks and appetisers are served. The first time I was there (solo) I ordeered an appetiser and glass of wine and tI found the portion quite large so just ordered another appetiser and cancelled the dinner reservation.Second time - did not order anything and got a high table within 20-30 mins. Had the mussels and fries and salad. All delicious! Service is very good and friendly...After 9pm - no line up and much calmer. Great place for Seafood!
tripadvisor,eng,1,experience;food;service,"I recently moved to Leicester and have now visited Middletons 4 times! The food is really excellent, beautifully cooked and served. The wine list is also very good. The Malbec is a definite must to try if you like red wine. The staff are all very pleasant and helpful. On one of my visits with friends the restaurant was quite busy and the wait was a tiny bit longer than normal but the staff were so attentive and advised in advance there may be a slight wait that it didn't matter. It is when there is a wait and the staff ignore you that it is annoying, none of that here, from the front of house to the servers the service is good. The chefs prepare and cook really good food as well. The steaks are superb. I have also been for a Sunday lunch which was really delicious. I have a friend coming soon and we will definitely visit again."

I do find even the smaller portions a little large, but that is just me and not a complaint. "

We all had fillet - some with the prawns, another with half a lobster and one just on it's own. The steaks were all perfectly cooked. The prawns and lobster were delicious. Unfortunately all the fries were overcooked considerably. Perhaps due to it being after 9pm. In any event, that was reported to the staff who immediately swapped them for fresh, lovely fries.This place is quite expensive but well worth it."

Мы пришли около 19, да, мест свободных не было, в очередь записывают, но только если ждать там же (не разыскивают). Мы подождали в баре и на удивление не долго и уже там было приятно: нам предложили на дегустацию устриц, мы даже не успели воспользоваться (доедали уже за столиком), как нас проводили к столику. Дальше был отличный семейный ужин: мы взяли большие комбонаборы, где были и холодные блюда и горячие - очень разнообразные блюда интересно попробовать за один раз, что-то пробовали впервые. Все было очень свежее и вкусное, удачно выбрали и вино, хотя оказалось из недорогих. Наша задумка на ужин в Амстердаме удалась на 100%. Современный ресторан с непринужденной обстановкой, отличным обслуживанием. Стоимость выше среднего, но оно того точно стоит. Мы очень довольны, это был лучший ресторан этого круиза, рекомендуем!"

Its very crowded with both locals and tourists, as the word is out that this is the place to go and be seen.  Its a bit noisy and the pace is franetic, but the servers do not rush you.  Its just not a quiet, relaxed place. Make reservations well in advance."

I don't think the prices are justified in the taste or portions (contrary) but I do think that the mood this place sets is nice!I have gone to Ellis St. Catherine and Jourdan numerous times and was never really disappointed (except when the decided to remove the mini-burgers from the menu, that was definitely sad!)."

It was instantly a match made in heaven and maybe this isn't an objective review as it perfectly fitted to our expectations.Didn't try much - two type of burgers, salad, ""les frites"" and some drinks - and nothing stayed behind! Can't give any further evidence. For our mood that night and for Leuven's central zone, it was exactly what we've needed and we've enjoyed each single bite."

Pequena, mas cheia de surpresas a cada vez esquina que se vira. E, ainda, tem o ar açucarado: as ruas têm cheiro de chocolate!.Para explorar, você pode alugar uma bike(a gente ama!), ou ir de barco, e ainda a pé.

Esqueça bate-volta, porque Bruges merece. Agora  algumas outras dicas :.🏫 Nos hospedamos no The Pand Hotel, que é lindo e tem uma localização maravilhosa, do lado da Markt e dos canais!

The service is quick and you can choose to either spend 20 minutes here or an hour.

Onze hoofdtaal proberen wij in het Engels te houden, maar dat zou er niet voor mogen zorgen dat jullie de kaart niet verstaan. Het feit dat we enkel met de kaart aanvaarden staat volledig in het teken van onze manager ter plaatse. We willen hen beschermen van fouten, diefstal en oneerlijkheden. De mensen zouden op voorhand de communicatie moeten krijgen dat we 'Cashless' zijn, dus dat zou geen probleem mogen geven. We geloven erin dat iedereen cashless kan betalen. Alvast heel erg bedankt voor jullie feedback. We hopen dat de spaghetti alsnog gesmaakt heeft?"

google_mybusiness,eng,-1,value,"BAVET asked me why the 3 star rating: well, it was a nice place to eat, the portions were rater big and it was decent food. But for me a 4 star restaurant is a restaurant I would recommend to friends or I would want to go back to. 5 star restaurant is one with food that makes you feel in heaven. My husband wants to come back one day, he loved the big portions and the concept of two sauces on one spaghetti. I'm much more a fan of healthier food."

It was also unevenly grilled, leaving grey patches here and there.  The bun felt dry and  flavorless. Overall, it felt like the various ingredients were doing their own thing, rather than coming together as a cohesive whole.  I hope the chefs do some work on flavor-balancing.  Service was lackluster and impersonal, making the place feel more like a fast food joint than a 'restaurant'."

Veel te lang op bestelling gewacht gisteravond. 30 min terwijl anderen die later binnen kwamen hun bestelling sneller kregen. We hadden zo'n trek! Maar het meest vervelende was de manier hoe de dame die ons hielp ermee omging. Laks en ongeïnteresseerd.
google_mybusiness,eng,-1,food;service,"Nice location. ""serving the best hamburger in town"" is a good approach, but not achieved. The meet was tasty and the bun also was delicious, but the overall presentation was a bit sloppy. The service probably was the slowest in town, but it was a busy time of the day.

Na dan nog eens 30 min wachten en een keer binnen gaan vragen of ze onze bestelling niet vergeten waren, eindelijk onze drankjes en ijsje gekregen. Schandalig!"

google_mybusiness,eng,1,experience,Specialty coffee place; great pour over coffee - many different origins. great cakes and super comfortable couches.
google_mybusiness,eng,1,experience,"The first coffee shop we found that served decaffeinated coffee, it seems to be an unusual request in Amsterdam. We also had a slice of apple pie, that was very good and the hot chocolate was, hot, another unusual event pretty much anywhere. Wi-Fi was also available so what more could you want, oh yes the sun was shining!"
google_mybusiness,eng,1,experience,"This coffee shop catched my eye because of provide Hario V60 filter coffee which mot commonly seen in Amsterdam, and it also pretty good. Yes, it has only a few small tables but a long one can share, everyone feel free to spend their time."
google_mybusiness,eng,-1,service,Good coffee and nice location but the staff is little grumpy.
yelp,eng,-1,experience;service,Wanted a table for one and they didn't want to seat me claiming that there are no tables available. When I asked about the open tables outside they still said no and claimed it's cold and they don't have enough staff.
yelp,eng,-1,experience;food,This is not a place for a real foodie. I order a finish dish and it was horrible. It was full of cracked pepper an no real seasoning other then that.
yelp,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"In short. My experience at this restaurant was terrible. I ordered a hamburger and they did not ask how to cook it and gave it well done and burnt. It tasted like cardboard. Also, the waiter was annoyed when we asked for another bottle of water. The waiter was rude and talked to us as if we were ignorant. The dessert was good, but the restaurant was not."
yelp,eng,-1,experience;value,"If you are looking for an Italian pizzeria, please do not go there. Restaurant is run by romanians not italians. Prices are exaggerated, 12£ for a micro pizza is much to much."

facebook,nld,-1,experience;service,"Wij hadden aangegeven iets te willen eten en drinken. Toen de drankjes kwamen kreeg ik een kapot glas. Na een kwartier te hebben gewacht, hebben we de serveerster gevraagd of het normaal was dat we zelf om eten moesten vragen. Gastronomie betekent toch dat het personeel dit aanbiedt ? Toen we wilden afrekenen bleek het pinapparaat niet te werken. Er loopt genoeg personeel rond, maar die weten absoluut niet wat ze moeten doen. Een AFrader!"
yelp,eng,1,food;value;environment,We had a lovely breakfast at the outdoor seating for a reasonable price. We both had the classic breakfast that had everything you would need.
google_mybusiness,eng,-1,service,"Updated 22 April 2019: 3 starService has become abysmal.  We arrived for lunch at 2.00pm, a waitress came by to ask for our drink order, after which we were promptly forgotten. We didn't receive the menu, and so we moved to a different table with menus. We waited another 20 minutes for someone to take our order, trying to catch the attention of the lone waitress who was busy behind the bar. We were unsuccessful - we couldn't even place an order. This is the second instance of less than ideal service here, and this time, the experience was downright terrible. Do not recommend this anymore.Updated 9 November 2018: 4 starThe experience this afternoon was a lot less impressive compared to last time - the ratings have been downgraded accordingly. Our lunch order of two sandwiches took an impressively long time. The quality of the old cheese sandwich (which we also had last time) was sub-par. The sandwich was dry, missed the attention to detail and flavour that had left us impressed the last time. Our server made a mistake with our order (we received a flat white instead of a double macchiato - not the same thing), but tried to serve it anyway saying they were pretty much the same thing. They obliged and corrected the mistake when we made it clear that it was not what we had ordered. This is still a good cafe, however, not as exceptional as the first time around.Original review August 2018: 5 starLovely cafe, wonderful cosy interiors, delightful menu, one can tell that a lot of thought has gone into the food, delicious! Very friendly staff. Would go here again and again."

yelp,nld,1,food;service,Scheltema heeft de mooiste boekenwinkel van NL en een hele fijne lunch cq koffietent. Bediening is goed en vriendelijk.
yelp,nld,0,food;service,"Bediend door een puisterige puber die van de hoed noch de rand weet. En dat terwijl het logo van Vascobelo een bolhoed is! Ook van koffie heeft het personeel geen kaas gegeten en dat terwijl ze prat gaan op hun koffieprut. Vragen naar een smaak die gewoon op de kaart staat, doet een vraagteken boven het hoofd van de bediening rijsen. Een persoon in de bediening, een die zich ontfermt over de broodjes en een die de drankjes laat druppelen. Je zou toch zeggen dat met een dergelijke taakverdeling een bestelling niet lang op zich laat wachten? Zeker niet met zo'n korte kaart. Maar de bestelling laat wel lang op zich wachten. Het opnemen van de bestelling vergt alleen al geduld. Misschien dat de lokatie, in boekhandel Scheltema, hieraan bijdraagt? Je kunt een heel oeuvre lezen voordat je bediend bent. Voor een tweede opname moet je zelf naar de bar, want de Belgische attentheid is niet meegekomen naar Amsterdam. De kwaliteit daarentegen, is wel de grens overgekomen want het brood is lekker. Uitgezonderd de croissantjes die verveeld op de counter liggen te wachten op een paar tandjes. Ook de taart is aantasting waard maar die wordt dan ook door een bekende banketbakker uit de Utrechtsestraat gebakken. Alleen betaal je er bij Vascobelo ruim twee maal zo veel voor. Komt vast door de dure bediening. Of de Belgische btw."
yelp,nld,1,food;service,Erg smaakvol en hoge kwaliteit. Bediening arrogant en we moesten erg lang wachten op ons eten.

google_mybusiness,eng,0,experience;value,Pricey but good
google_mybusiness,eng,-1,experience;food;service,Terrible.  We went there last Sunday.  The roast was appalling with chewy and fatty beef.  There was also hardly any beef on the plate.  The vegetables were appalling.  Overcooked and cold.  The chef stood in the entrance to the kitchen with filthy trousers on.  I had calamari and a waldorf salad.  The waldorf salad had one grape in it cut in half and two tiny slices of apple and no nuts - funny sort of waldorf.  My whole meal was bland and tasteless.  The service was slow and when we did get someone at our table they were very condescending.  We would not put a foot in the place again.  Absolutely appalling.
google_mybusiness,eng,1,experience;food;service;environment,Lovely meal in a great atmosphere. Waiter was extremely helpful.
google_mybusiness,eng,1,experience;food;service,"Good food, nice staff. I had my little one with me and they have been very nice providing me some hot water to warm the milk and they have a changing table as well."
facebook,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"I’ve been a long time fan of Middleton’s, but have come in tonight to celebrate a special occasion and have had hands down the worst dining experience of my adult life. Ignoring the various problems my friends have had with their orders: We pre-ordered and it’s still taken 3 hours for 2 courses to be put in front of me; my steak was over cooked, the wedges undercooked and the asparagus was poorly prepared with the woody, inedible part of the stems being served.Sorry to say I really don’t think I’ll be back."

Service can be a little slow but I think that is more to do with the size, of the restaurant and probably lack of staff as they always looked super busy, but we're always really polite and helpful. Food has improved over the months as well."
google_mybusiness,eng,1,experience;food,"Very comfy place and super helpful, genuine staff. The sides are amazing. The dessert was life-affirming (white choc and Bailey's cheesecake). But the 12oz serloin I got was disappointing. Perfectly cooked to medium but super chewy. It was clearly just a bad cut and unfortunate. Everything else was top notch. Will try again but avoid the serloin."

The water and some fruit is free to take on the table. If you are vegan you only have 1 choice for the ball and 2 choices for the side dish. The salad has no dressing for the vegans but it does contain chickpeas which I found surprising. Maybe in the future there will be a dressing, at least I hope so.Because of the limited choice for the vegans I give this 3 stars but the food was tasty and the people were friendly."

The staff are reasonably friendly but nothing above and beyond - the menu is nice but nothing exceptional.

Fine in a pinch, but ultimately falls closer to tourist fodder, and there are plenty of better options round."

Truly.  I don't want to over-hype it, but my wife and I both thought the food was fabulous.  We ate before seeing Phantom just next door. Simply delicious.Now...the negatives.  Worst service I have come across in a long time. The front manager seemed friendly enough, and the man who brought out the food was pleasant as well, but our waiter, Jorge, was the rudest person I've met in the whole of London.  He went out of his way to actually ignore us and treat us poorly.  This is not a miscommunication or a misunderstanding.  Maybe he was just having a bad night, but wow- I honestly can't think of a time when I've had a worse server.  He single-handedly turned an easy 5-star review into a 3 star."

google_mybusiness,eng,-1,experience;service,"We visited for lunch on Monday, we ordered a Mocktail (nojito) and a Peroni from a lovely older gentleman who was serving us, I even pointed at the nojito and he nodded saying a ‘non alcoholic mojito’. We ordered our food and enjoyed it even though it was a long wait between servings and the restaurant lacked staff. As I carried on drinking my Mocktail  I started to feel very nauseous. The reason why I ordered the Mocktail and not the alcoholic cocktail was due to being on a course of antibiotics that would react with any alcohol. Upon receiving the bill we were charged for a cocktail, once I raised my concerns with the older gentleman who served us, he looked at me in petty, put his hand on my shoulder and asked ‘ Do you feel ok though’ I was shocked and appalled for two reasons, one for being served something different to what I had ordered and two for the waiters behaviour when I highlighted the issue, I explained that I only wanted a Mocktail as I couldn’t drink and all he said was ''sorry, I will buy you a drink next time''. We were shocked and disappointed at the lack of professionalism and his attitude when it came to dealing with this situation. I have dined at Middleton's many of times but have never been in such a situation, I suffered severe sickness for two days to due being served something I did not order, and wish that both your staff and waitress could take greater care in such situations in the future. I will not be returning to the restaurant in the future as this has been a very disappointing experience."
facebook,eng,-1,experience;reputation;service;food,"I don’t know where to start. I have never before taken time out to write a review or complaint about an establishment but me and my partner’s experience definitely warrants one. We pre booked our table over the phone for 7:30pm on Saturday 2nd March 2019, being our anniversary.We arrived on time but were asked to wait at the bar whilst our table was being prepared.After 30 minutes we were seated with no apology. Once seated it seemed to take forever and a day for somebody to tend to us. When somebody finally came we order a bottle of Rioja. Unfortunately, the waiter who took the order must have fell of the face of the earth as this order did not arrive.Only after a further 30 minutes when my partner went to the bar in search for our drinks order, was a different waiter sent over to be reminded of what it was we ordered. Still, with no urgency from the staff we finally got our bottle only to be served along side 2 gin glasses to drink it from. We were told they had ran out of wine glasses only for the table directly next to us to be served a bottle of white wine, with wine glasses less than 5 minutes later. After one hour since arrival we were more than ready to order our food. We ordered mussels to share as a starter, I ordered a fillet medallion with dauphinois, mixed greens and a side of peppercorn sauce for my main.My partner ordered the vegetarian mushroom wellington with dauphinois and mixed greens also, for her main.We waited a further HOUR for our starter to arrive after asking staff multiple times when it might arrive. When it did arrive it was lovely. By this time I decided to time how long it would take for our mains to appear, we waited a further 90 minutes for this to happen. When they finally started to arrive my partners well done and over cooked mushroom wellington came out 5 minutes before my own main, which came with a side of chips rather than dauphinois and without peppercorn sauce. After sending it back to be corrected I finally got what I ordered, along side barely warm peppercorn sauce. All in this time my partner had almost finished her plate due to being so hungry. We ate our mains separately and with water as our wine had by this time long gone and didn’t want the hassle of ordering anything else! By the time we had finished our mains the kitchen had turned all lights off and the chef had left the building on his phone. We were near enough the last party in the restaurant. Once we had finished our plates very clearly unhappy, a waiter approached us with a half hearted apology and explained how they were in the middle of changing their team, which of course had nothing to do with us. All of this time the staff had no urgency toward us and seemed all over the place. It was almost offensive that on our anniversary night we were experiencing such a nightmare whilst staff were leaning against the bar chatting, we even saw 2 members of staff massaging each other’s shoulders and at one point a waitress twerked whilst waiting for food to deliver to her table. We had booked our table for the specific time of 7:30pm so as we could enjoy our night beyond our meal and go to a few bars. We left the restaurant at 11:30pm with our night completely ruined and in no mood to continue our night resulting in a taxi straight home. With our career’s and my partner being from Leeds and myself being from Leicester, we consider our time together very sacred. So to have such a disastrous night on our anniversary was very unsettling and upsetting.Overall, a total of 4 hours spent here that night, a catalog of errors and a disaster from start to finish! I feel as though my seven paragraphs do not mirror and stress the horrors we experienced that evening. We will most certainly avoid dining here ever again and I can’t stress how much everyone reading this should do the same. Especially if it is a special occasion! Avoid avoid avoid!"

Mais proposer des Burgers aussi cher et faire payer en plus si on veut des frites avec c'est déjà exagéré. Mais les Burgers que nous avons mangés (et pas terminé) étaient digne de restauration de groupe. Donc quand on veut faire de la restauration de groupe on pratique les mêmes tarifs.

google_mybusiness,ita,1,service;food,I panini sono davvero gustosi e la scelta è molto ampia.Il locale è davvero carino e ben curato e lo staff molto gentile.Attenzione i costi non sono bassi: i panini costano da €15 in su. È praticamente obbligatorio prenotare altrimenti difficilmente riuscirete a sedervi... È sempre pieno!
google_mybusiness,nld,1,food;environment,"Lekker eten, veel sfeer en gezelligheid. De namen van de burgers komen uit de serie ""boardwalk empire"" een must see serie"
google_mybusiness,ita,1,food;service,Hamburger molto buono. Otti.a scelta di birre. Servizio un pochino lento. 2 hamburger  1 porzione di alette di pollo 1 birra (33) e 1 acqua piccola: 46Euro
google_mybusiness,eng,1,food;innovation,Fantastic place for food and beer. Each of the burgers is paired with a beer. Lots of selection for food as well as non beer options for drink. Lovely little courtyard in the middle which is fantastic on a warm day. Reasonably priced too.  Not to mention the burgers were delicious
google_mybusiness,eng,-1,value,Seriously overpriced. Taste and quantity doesn't do justice to the price.
google_mybusiness,fra,1,food;innovation,Très bon burger et une super idée pour les bières mais évitez les bouteilles d'eau car TROP CHER

google_mybusiness,spa,0,food,Las hamburguesas y el sitio  no están mal.  El servicio muy lento y sistema complicado para pagar si vas en grupo. Te hacen pagar por mesa. Precio medio pero adecuado teniendo en cuenta que comer en Brujas no es barato. Conviene hacer reserva sobre todo en fin de semana ya que se llena
google_mybusiness,eng,1,environment;food;reputation,"Great beer selection, amazing food and a good vibe all around. Highly recommended!"
google_mybusiness,eng,1,food,"Loved the vegan selection of both burgers and sides. A nut burger might not sound too exciting, but the patty is above any average home made vegan one, and the flavour combinations are great. Preferred this way above a beyond burger with average toppings. Plenty of dressings and veggies and overall well thought through flavors. The wasabi burger was a personal favourite."

google_mybusiness,eng,-1,experience;food,"Had an awful meal last night. There were 4 of us. The 2 men had mixed grills, and were dry, overcooked and barely warm. Myself and my friend had the 10oz rump steaks. Both of us asked for medium rare. When they came, the steaks were both overcooked and the meals were cold. We sent them back. The men decided to keep their meals. When our replacement meals came, my friend had a fresh steak, and although not medium rare, she decided it would be ok. Mine however, was her original steak, that still had the small piece missing that she had cut off when it came out the first time! How your chef could have possibly thought that this was acceptable amazes me. Firstly to give me somebody else's returned food, and secondly to send me back a reheated steak that was overcooked in the first place. Obviously this was sent back, and l had to wait for another meal. By the time it came (and the steak was still medium and not medium rare) the others had finished their meals. I gave some of my steak to my husband, as it was tough and l couldn't eat it. They did take my meal off the bill, but l still find this to be awful service. We have eaten in your restaurant before and had lovely meals, so it will not put us off coming again, but if this had have been our first time, we would definitely not be back!"

De sidedishes zijn een instinker en de keuken op zich vond ik niet overtuigend net. Het personeel is niet horeca geschoold en vergist zich vaak.  Voor die prijs klopt het plaatje voor mij niet helemaal. On top zijn er stilaan zodanig veel filialen dat het nog meer een Mc Do karakter ontwikkeld.

instagram,swe,1,experience;food,"Det här med att ”det går snabbare att köpa med mat ute påväg hem” är inte applicerbart på matnördarna som älskar att ta bilder på allt de äter. Det kan jag bekräfta. Att laga mat hemma: max 10 min om jag vill att det ska gå fort (plus 10 min att handla). Köpa mat ute: 10 mins promenad till ställe, beställ, betala, ta hem det, lägga det på en fin tallrik, hålla upp vinet och lägga dit en fin blomma för syns skull. Sen välja och redigera bild för #IGflödet. Ja vi snackar 40 minuter. 🥳✨ Men jag vet ju att den här salladen från paniniinternazionale och levainbrödet från vetekatten är värt det! Trevlig kväll allihopa. 💚"

Jag talar då om det då blir mjöl på det glutenfria brödet.

Side  salad and stoemp were good as well, and place was nice and clean, quiet, hipstery/minimalist.  Free lemon water and fruit (apples while we were there) on the table.  What a great place for a quick and reasonably convenient lunch break without being stuck in the heart of tourist epicenter. ...at least while we were there in mid-April.   Bathrooms were clean as well, a bit tight, serviceable."
yelp,eng,-1,value,"I came here for dinner one night and had a fantastic experience! This restaurant is super clean, modern and minimalist. They have an inside seating area and some tables outside as well. The staff immediately greeted us and were super friendly. They were very accommodating with my husband's garlic and onion allergy and he was so happy that he could have something here. For dinner, I opted for the classic pork ball served on top of an arugula  salad with tomatoes and cheese with a light dressing. I also had the lemonade of the day which was so refreshing! The pork ball was unlike anything I have ever tasted before. The outside was crispy without being greasy and the inside was a delicious, savory, cheesy bundle of joy. A ball and side to eat in was 14.50 Euro, so slightly pricey but not too bad for the city and the quality is great. Overall, great food, decent prices, friendly staff, clean/modern ambiance and great location!"

From te moment we decided we needed beers and burgers, strange things happened.... This restaurant has it's own beer: 'Rostekop' (redhead). Every redhead gets a little present, a free 'Rostekop' beer. Also, my name is Lucienne and there were 2 dishes with versions of my name: the 'Sweet Lucy' and the 'Lucky Luciano'. My last name is Van Os ('From Ox') and what was on the wall... A head of an ox! This is what they call 'destiny'. However, I had the 'Hot Gillian' burger, and it was delicious.

facebook,nld,-1,service;food,"’niet aanraden’ is een groot woord. Maar enkele dingen zouden beter kunnen: Heb hier een lekkere vegan burger gegeten (super dat ze die opties aanbieden). Als dessert bestelde ik ‘vegan appeltaart’ en mijn vriend een chocomousse. Eerst waren ze de bestelling vergeten.Na achter de bestelling te vragen kwam mijn appeltaart: MET IJS erbij?! Dit stond niet op het menu? Lekker dacht ik! Argwanend nam ik een klein hapje van het ijs: ja, het was roomijs van koemelk, dat proef je meteen. Dit leg je toch niet bij een stuk VEGAN appeltaart??? Na lang twijfelen sprak ik er toch een ober over aan om te vragen of het ijs ook vegan was. Vluchtig antwoord: ja goh het is erg druk, ik weet natuurlijk niet uit welke bak ze jouw ijs geschept hebben... Ik vraag: Oh hebben jullie ook vegan ijs dan? Hij twijfelend en niet overtuigend: ‘euh... ja ...’ . Hij stelde voor om een nieuw stuk appeltaart te geven (zonder ijs), maar dat was ook niet nodig. Er staat nergens op de kaart dat ze ijsjes hebben, dus zou me verwonderen dat ze voor vegans een bak soja ijs hebben om bij de vegan appeltaart te geven (wat niet op de kaart staat). Als dat wel zo zou zijn: super! Mijn ijs was 100% geen soja ijs, maar echt roomijs. Jammer dat hier niet over nagedacht werd en de ober niet goed wist wat te doen/antwoorden bij mijn vraag ‘want het is heel druk’. Dat het druk is, is geen argument. Na nogmaals naar de chocomousse te vragen kwam deze er ook aan. Argument ‘het is erg druk’ + heb deze zelf uitgeschept/gehaald in de keuken voor je’."

And when we find a place like Greenway with the entire menu being vegan, you have hit a jackpot.The food from here is great, we had the black bean burger, Thai curry with rice and their souo of the day. The burger is a must have and their Thai curry was delicious. My toddler drank up the soup in no time and wanted more. Their vegetable and fruit juice was good and they have plenty of dessert options.On top of this, the service is excellent! Very courteous staff/owners. When my toddler threw a tantrum, she was given toys that had her mesmerized and us relieved. It was most unexpected and we were pleasantly surprised.I would highly recommend visiting this place if you are a vegan or not. Great food, fabulous service and convenient location."

yelp,eng,1,food,"I was looking for a quick, fresh and light bite before my long flight. The salad I got was perfect! Good selection and fresh ingredients."
yelp,eng,0,food;value,"Just got the low carb bowl plus veggies. The chicken is super flavorful and I like the spring mix salad. The only downside to this place is that charge so many extras for items other than guac. For instance, if you want rice with that salad: extra. Veggies: extra. Quinoa: extra. Basically anything that isn't listed in the entree description is gonna turn that basic sounding/tasting $9 bowl into a $13 bowl."
yelp,eng,1,food,"Best place to grab food in O'Hare, there's a reason why the line is always long and full of airline staff lol.If you're keto they have a great option called the ""low-carburrito""Only complaint is that they no longer serve the breakfast low-carb scramble, but the crew is friendly and always make me something that best resembles the old menu item which I appreciate."
yelp,eng,-1,food,"This gets a 2 since it is in an airport and I expect bad food. The care of making the food and ingredients was relatively good in my burrito. I had the veggie veggie. However, try to find the salt shaker. There was no salt at all in the beans. No salt in the sautéed veggies. No salt in the other veggies. No salt in the rice. No salt in the salsa. If I had ordered a meat dish, it may well have been inedible. Taste your food!!!"
yelp,eng,1,food,"My flight was delayed so I had the opportunity to grab lunch at the airport.  I saw pilots in line for Burrito Beach so I figured the food had to be good.  I ordered the Lo Carburrito (baby greens, grilled chicken, cheese, salsa, guac) and it was delicious. It had a little spice, and tasted very fresh.  I highly recommend!"
yelp,eng,1,food;value,Very fast easy and fresh fair prices! Good quality and friendly service! Lots of ingredients to choice from and it was nice to have a healthy meal and not have to pay 3 times the price!
yelp,eng,-1,service,"Waiting for 15 minutes and my shrimp burrito was still not being made then I was told that I would have to wait another 15 minutes for the vegetables to be cooked firstI asked for a refund, the cashier ignored me and proceeded to ring up the next person then processed my refund with no apology, no response."
yelp,eng,1,value;food,"Fresh and tasty at a reasonable price for an airport. It has a long line because it is worth waiting for. Both burritos and bowls as well as tacos. For burritos, choose between a flour, whole wheat or spinach tortilla. 2 kinds of chicken, Chipotle marinated or Buffalo, o had the former. Excellent value got a major airport for court."
yelp,eng,1,experience;service;food,"This time around I had a 5 star experience.. legit was happier to order.. I got a burrito this time and it tasted 10x better than it normally would because it was free thanks to the ppl at Dos Toros listening to my complaint on their other location. They gave me a cool card that allowed me a free meal. Aside from it being free the service was extremely better.. now I can give it the credit it should get... I know last time I said I wouldn't come back but they made up for that visit.. I'd gladly return... (Coronas are only $5 here too sooooooo... yeah, I'll be back)"
yelp,eng,1,value,"These burritos were a generous size. I ordered the Cabo shrimp burrito. While the burrito was hefty and full of rice, beans and whatever else I added, I found myself wishing there was more meat. A combo burrito might have been nice instead. They do warn you of the 4 minute wait to grill up the shrimp, and it was still a very quick turnaround to get my food. My tortilla held together well with only a little bit of dripping. The foil wrapper kept it all from spilling all over me. I would make sure you're ready with what you want to order. They didn't really ask me what kind of tortilla I wanted, so I got the regular instead of the wheat. Then they started calling out several choices very quickly, so be ready to make several fast decisions so you don't feel the pressure of holding up the line. Also make sure to tell them what you want even if they don't call it out. They didn't call out the veggies or the quinoa for me, which was fine, but there was some other mixture next to it that I might have wanted. Of course, it probably would have made my burrito soggy, so probably for the best."
yelp,eng,-1,service,"To begin with (literally), the lines are very long. However, due to the efficient and organized team, the line diminishes quickly. They have nearly identical menu options as Chip***le, and it's to the point. This also helps with the efficiency, considering there are only 3 options to order from. I recommend figuring out which of the 3 options you want whilst you wait in line cause it's pretty annoying when people drag at the counter. Anyways, food is great. A little salty but great. If food was all I was critiquing I would give it 5 stars. However, I don't appreciate how they hide spoons from you, until you specifically ask them for it. Employees also beware, there are no discounts for you."
yelp,eng,1,value,"I'm pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food! Has to have a lot of good flavor or else I'm out! These guys nailed it with the chipotle chicken burrito! Ask for hot sauce if you like it spicy! The hot sauce is really good with the amazing chicken! Priced very well, 8$ for my burrito!"
yelp,eng,1,food;service,"Weather was perfect for the open air feel, they weren't overly busy and it was easy to snag a table. The food was great! Chipotle vibe where you create your own. Free tap water with cups in seating area. Only tables and seating for maybe 15-18 people. People were friendly, too!"
yelp,eng,1,food;value,"My expectations of airport food court fare are low -- I've had too many expensive, not quite fresh, not quite hot entrees. But My baja chicken burrito at Burrito Beach was excellent. Tasty, fresh, and efficiently made to order. Portion was large enough for left overs, all at a very reasonable price. I wouldn't hesitate to stop in again the next time I'm at O'Hare."
yelp,eng,0,service;food,"The fish tacos were very tasty. However, the crispy quesadilla is NOT crispy and resembles a burrito. I would not recommend it. The service is good and fast."
yelp,eng,1,value,"The sirloin steak burrito is where it's at! There are plenty of breakfast, vegan and vegetarian options. They seem to have specials on their chalkboard menu like fish tacos. I don't think their prices are too bad to either my burrito is about $8.29 for the burrito. You have a choice of tacos, toast burrito, rice bowl, nachos or crispy quesadillas. I liked the beans and rice with the burrito and mild salsa was tasty. I say check it out I like it. I would totally have it again if I was at the Northwestern building heading to some doctor's appointment and wanted a bite to eat."
yelp,eng,-1,service;value,"I will not visit this location anymore, it is RIDICULOUS! Staff - RUDE as hell, it's a lunch rush, so what. Also, they are priced fine overall but the guacamole portions are laughable, insulting even. $1.50 for a teaspoon of guacamole, WTF!?! Fix it. And learn how to wrap a damn burrito."
yelp,eng,1,service,"The owner clearly cares about this place and how it comes across to its customers. When we were here just after a procedure just this morning, my wife is allergic to onions and he offered to cut and give her just a plain half of an avocado. Additionally, they went in the back to find cilantro even though it wasn't one of their normal morning offerings. Come and eat here for reasonable price and great care of the proportion of your food!"
yelp,eng,1,food;service,Oh my goodness! I got a burrito bowl with everything I wanted included and it was so delicious. The Baja chicken was flavorful and the salsas and other toppings were all so good.  Service was quick and friendly and I felt I got a really good value for the portions.
yelp,eng,1,food;service,"1. It was delicious. The fish tacos tasted much healthier and were much more flavorful than you can find at most places in Chicago. 2. The employees are nailing it order after order and keeping a steady clip. Every single person was kind, smiling, and hard-working. I just received customer service that I didn't think was synonymous with a faster food place. There is an excellent hustle here. I'll be back!3. The music (playlist) has been one excellent song after another.  Lou Reed, Smokey Robinson, The Velvet Underground...one great song after another. Great taste in food and music at Burrito Beach!4.  Nice decor with pretty little floral arrangements on each table.  This did not feel like a hospital dining option...it was REALLY nice.5.  They also have custard.  Enough said."
yelp,eng,1,food,I was craving a breakfast burrito and this was the perfect spot where I can build my own. I got the special but instead of bacon used chorizo. So good!!!

facebook,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"My husband has been talking about coming here for a little while, so we decided to finally give it a try. On arriving things were fine, we ordered drinks which where lovely, we had room temp tap water on our table in bottles. We ordered our food, but soon noticed that another couple who arrived around 15mins after us got their mains before us and were half way through already and there was another family who had their mains servered around the same time we ordered, they had finished and had ordered their desserts and they were arriving yet we were still waiting for our food to arrive. My husband decided this was unacceptable and decided we should leave, so the waitress decided to inform us that it had only been half an hr then charge us for our drinks... I do beleive it was more on the 45min side, it's not so much the wait but watching everyone around us getting served while we twiddle our thumbs totally in the dark as to why we had to wait... Not that busy when we arrived either. 1st and last time we will visit your establishment."

google_mybusiness,eng,-1,service,"Good food but poor customer service. I have been to this restaurant many times and used to like it as it offered good quality affordable burgers. It still does as a matter of fact but my last couple of experiences here have been tainted by the poor customer service and the wait for the meal. Already twice, and both times when sitting upstairs, I have had to wait substantially for my meal (more thank 35 minutes, which is a lot for a burger place). In both circumstances I had almost finished my drink by the time the food arrived (and let me add that when ordering tea, twice I received the wrong tea bag, had to wait for a new one and in the meantime the warm water became even milder). To add to the frustration was the fact that other tables received their food before I did although they had ordered later. There was one couple who ordered just before we did who waited almost 50 minutes for their food and then had to remind the staff that they had not yet received the sides to their meal. Having said that, these times I experienced delays have been when the restaurant was particularly busy; however, the rudeness of the staff did not help bear with the frustration: the table next to mine experienced a confrontation with the waitress; I had received no apologies for the wait, and to add to it all, when asked at the till if I had a good meal, I explained my frustrations and received as an answer ""oh it is normal when it is busy"" rather than an apology. Sad to see how poor staff training and an understaffed kitchen can affect what could have otherwise been a good meal."

De huisgemaakte cocktails, ice tea’s een verfrissende aanrader. Ruime keuze aan burgers. Voor ieder wat wils, veggie, zalm, kip, lam etc. Er is zelfs een speciale menu voor studenten. Enkel jammer dat iedere burger hetzelfde broodje heeft. Voor de prijs had ik daar graag wat meer variatie in gezien. Frietjes voortreffelijk, krokant, intense aardappelsmaak en ogen zelfgemaakt (geen diepvriesstuff). Bediening vlot en hartelijk. Bij binnenkomst word je een tafel toegewezen, betaling is aan kassa vooraan. Tip als je aperitieft best melden dat ze wachten met het brengen van de burgers tot die genuttigd is.  Men houdt daar namelijk geen rekening mee. Eten op het binnenterras is al even niet mogelijk, jammer. Plaatsjes vooraan buiten zijn meestal bezet. Blijkbaar is afhaal hier mogelijk."

De veggie vol au vent was voor mij niet zo super - iets te veel vleesvervanger en héél weinig champignons, en de algemene smaak van de saus was niet echt mijn ding.

facebook,eng,-1,experience;service,"PLEASE BE AWARE BONES IN KIDS HADDOCK GOUJONS OF THE KIDS MENU!I visited Middleton steak house in Leicester on Fathers day with my husband and 2 kids, a 2 year old and 10month old. We ordered my 2 year old haddock goujons from little eaters menu. Half way through my daughters meal I noticed she wasnt breathing, her eyes where getting wider and wider and watering and she was getting very red in the face. Once she didnt answer me when asking if she was ok I knew straight away she was choking. My husband then had to stand her up on the chair and frantically hit her back to try and get what ever it was she was choking on out. After a minute or so of my daughter struggling to catch breath she eventually asked for her juice and knew something was in her throat as she was trying to cough it out herself. My husband then took my daughter to the toilet and stick his fingers down her throat which eventually cleared it. My daughter from that point refused all food. I then decided to break some of the Haddock up to feed my 10month old to find 2 fish bones in the fish. When finding these bones i knew this was what my daughter swallowed which got lodged in her throat. I am horrified that bones are being served in the fish which was ordered off the kids menu. Thorough checks should have been in place to make sure this doesn't happen to any child ordering off this menu. If I hadn't have gone to feed my 10month old we would never have found the bones and been able to warn others. This left my daughter upset and it took her untill today to stop talking about it. Also everyone in the restaurant knew my 2 year old was choking and we needed help. However 2 members of staff walked past as if nothing was happening. As soon as I alerted the manager of what just happened all I got was an apology. I then spoke to the manager again to let him know we was leaving as I was so angry with the whole situation and experience from the staff and manager when informing him about the bone. It wasnt untill I was leaving and he asked for the bones to show the chef I then expressed I am keeping a bone for a picture he then decided to take my details for a lady called Emily to be calling me back which I still havnt received this call. I feel the restaurant havnt taken full responsibility or care in regards to this and it could have been a lot worse then what it was. This could be another child next time which could turn either way."

facebook,eng,1,experience;food;service,"we had a lovely fathers day meal Sunday for both my partner and my dad. the food was lovely but what was best was the very attentive waiter we had (wish I'd got his name but we did tell the manager how great he was) from the moment we were seated he was fantastic, realising before we even did that the steak knife needed to be moved from where my 4 year old was seated. he offered to ask the chefs to make battered chicken for our picky son. he replaced not only the fatty meat on my dads roast but the entire plate of food fresh much to my dads delight (who loves to moan 😂) he interacted really well with the children, was conscientious of my fathers visual impairment and generally just very friendly, polite and nothing was too much for him. it's very rare to take out a baby, preschooler, teenager and a partially sighted pensioner and have a relaxing enjoyable time but we had a lovely lunch and everyone enjoyed it. thanks to the lovely waiter who served us. we have been fans of the food since Middletons opened and now we are big fans of the service too!"

Water kwam na 5 minuten, glazen wijn 10 minuten later. Voorgerecht werd geserveerd, maar zonder bestek. Dan komt iemand anders daarna het bestek brengen en weer iemand anders de bordjes. En allemaal met tussenpozen. Hoofdgerecht laat vervolgens lang op zich wachten (zeker 45 min). En als je dan wil betalen, duurt het weer even voor de rekening komt. Als die komt en ik met mijn pas in de hand zeg dat ik wil pinnen, moet nog even het pinapparaat gehaald worden. En je raadt het al, dat duurt weer even. Zie de ober vervolgens wel allerlei andere mensen bedienen en met collega's praten. Ben op een gegeven moment dus zelf maar naar binnen gegaan in om te betalen.... Eten was zich redelijk en plek is prima, maar heb mij vanwege de respectloze bediening mateloos geïrriteerd."

We arrived at the restaurant and the staff seemed friendly enough, the service was quite quick and we received complimentary water as soon as we sat down. After browsing the menu we decided on Calamari for a starter which was just over £5- the calamari was good but it was a very small serving for the price. For a main I had a burger which was adequate, nothing special especially as half the burger was lukewarm and the other half was hot. My partner had the Porterhouse Steak which was around £34 but quite frankly it wasn’t worth this. There was a large steak, what looked like a squashed mushroom and a tomato with some fries. We were very disappointed by this- food was average but highly priced. So unfortunately we shall not be eating here again."

Luckily the friendly waiter was able to get us a free table without any waiting time, and was also very fast when taking our orders and getting them to us.There were some very interesting sounding burgers to choose from - also for vegetarians, if needed - and also some starters and side dishes which deviated from the generic ones we knew from other burger restaurants.After a very short waiting time we were able to try our ordered food ourselves, and we were really satisfied with our choices - the meat was medium-grilled and both burgers were really tasty. The ""exotic"" starters were also really fine, and definitely worth a recommendation.The waiter continued to fulfill his first positive impression by e.g. immediately noticing our empty glasses and asking if we needed another drink.All in all this restaurant is definitely recommendable for any burger lover - even for vegetarian ones."

With its Art-Nouveau like elements such as the use of iron and steel, the drawings of swallows and decorative motifs, Bavet Bailli will have an ode to our man, Victor Horta. The man who revolutionized architecture in the 19th century and gave us New Art.

Het eten zelf was zeer goed, maar op zich niets spectaculairs (het blijft gewoon pasta). Over de bediening is er niet te klagen. In het algemeen zeer tevreden: ik kom hier zeker terug!"
google_mybusiness,fra,-1,food,"Décevant. Le service laisse vraiment à désirer : de jeunes serveurs inexpérimentés qui ne tiennent pas compte des demandes dans les commandes, il est donc nécessaire de se répéter et de renvoyer la nourriture pour avoir précisément ce que vous avez demandé.. Au niveau des burgers, le goût est assez fade, le pain est sec, les aliments décrits sur la carte ne sont pas forcément ce que vous retrouver (j'étais censée avoir des poivrons rouges et des noix de pecan.. Au final je reçois un burger de soja avec des noix normales à côté). Les burger vege sont proposés sans fromage (vegan et végétarien ne sont pas les mêmes chose au passage, et dans tous le cas le fromage vegan existe et c'est un peu honteux de faire payer un supplément pour un ingrédient de base dans un burger). Bref le goût n'y est vraiment pas (sauf pour les frites de patate douce hors de prix), et le prix exhorbitant n'est vraiment pas mérité pour le coup.. mieux vaut aller chez huggy's bar pour ce budget là au moins le cadre, le service et le goût sont meritants.Mention spéciale pour la terrasse non protégée (pas de toit) avec des pigeons qui defequent sur les clients et les tables..👌 Malheureusement pas une bonne expérience du tout comme vous l'aurez compris, je déconseille vivement."

Either these reviews are fake or these people have never tried a real good burger.I tried the lamb burger which is advertised with guacamole sauce as main ingredient. The supposededly guacamole was a layer as thin as how you would put butter on bread. Shameful!The burger was bland, tasteless, had no sides whatsoever (no salad, no rice, no fries or whatever else; it was just this burger in the middle of the plate. At 17 euro (including the overpriced water) this meh experience made me feel like i threw money on the garbage. At this price , i expect something delicious and most of all Filling, which was not the case here. Was still hungry at the end.Would put only one star but since the area is nice and has a great atmosphere, i’m giving it an extra star, because it might be nice to just hang there with just a drink on that fabulous Ste Catherine Place.Will still look in Brussels to find a great burger."

formitable,nld,-1,food;reputation,"Hi,Het was gisteren mijn allereerste keer in een vegetarisch restaurant. Veganistisch was het zelfs. Als fervent restaurant bezoeker, denk ik te weten dat er heel veel mogelijk is met eten. Zelfs zonder dierlijke producten. Om die reden was ik ook niet echt bang dat er iets zou missen, enkel omdat het een vegan restaurant is. Ik moet echter toegeven, dat ik wel wat gemist heb. Het hoofdgerecht was een halve bloemkool met groente eromheen. Dat was toch wel een kleine teleurstelling. Er is toch, zelfs of wellicht zeker, meer mogelijk dan enkel een halve bloemkool als hoofdgerecht. Ik had graag een ""WOW!"" ervaring gehad, die me had doen twijfelen waarom ik ooit vlees of vis gegeten heb. Helaas is dit niet het geval.Vriendelijke groet & veel succes!Marco"

Al bij de bestelling gunden ze ons amper tijd. Dit werd logischerwijs wel gecompenseerd door een snelle bediening. De ober deed overigens wel zijn best deed om vriendelijk te blijven. Wel vermaande hij tot enkele keren toe dat het echt ging sluiten, dit bezorgde wat stress tijdens het eten. Er werd naast ons gewacht tot ons glas leeg was, wat toch wel een opgeblazen gevoel gaf aan de maag. Er blijft toch iemand in het restaurant voor afwas of kuiswerk. Waarom de mensen zo opjagen? De rest van onze schotel kregen we wel netjes mee naar huis. Het heeft nog gesmaakt, want het was op en top lekker en speciaal voor pastagerecht."

google_mybusiness,eng,1,food;service,"(Detailed review below)Food - 4/5Ambience - 3/5Accessibility - 2/5Cost - 3/5Service - 4/5Food - The options for the burgers are really great! Always exciting to go to a gourmet burger restaurant and seeing what sort of special burgers are available! I ended up with the Guaco Waco Lamb burger which came looking a bit dry but was quite tasty! There were some condiments on the table (ketchup and  tabasco sauces) to help elevate the flavours if necessary. The sweet potato fries were good too and the better option to the plain fries, in my opinion.Ambience - The restaurant is quite nicely decorated; chequered tiles, motifs on the walls and has some influence of an American deli. It’s not quite cosy and is quite a long and narrow space. There are sitting areas outside but be mindful that people do smoke!Accessibility - The outside areas are accessible but there are steps leading into the restaurant and going towards the back dining area. Space is also quite tight.Cost - It’s slightly more expensive to experience the gourmet burgers if you do like your non-standard burgers, it’s certainly worth a stop to try them out!Service - Staff were friendly and helpful; we were sat outside and when the weather made a turn for the worse and they quickly moved our dishes to an available table inside."

There are of more traditional options of course, the Kerelan fried chicken was insanely good. However I left slightly unsatisfied by the food, but not for a lack of quality, more personal preference.

I didn't like them because they are so dry, and you have to eat them with knive and fork because they are so big, which is a nuicense. Besides, if you are handicapped, make sure you have been to the toilet before. Else you won't get there."

However, on my most recent visit, the experience was very poor. There was 5 of us, including my young son.The food; I’m not sure what to say except that the quality and attention to detail has really gone down. Our starters were luke warm and had shrunk in portion size. My son’s garlic bread came out last. Then the mains, well we ordered 4 steak’s and a main from the kids menu. Despite asking for all 4 steaks to be cooked medium, they all varied with one being under cooked. This had to be sent back. My children’s meals came last, again, and I had to remind the staff that we were still waiting for these ! Our onion rings were stale/hard and the mushrooms looked as if they’d been sat there all day.I’d expect this inconsistency from other main stream restaurant / grills however not Middletons. I’ve never had to send a steak back before let alone have 4 steaks that weren’t cooked to our liking. It was just a bit too sloppy :(I don’t know what’s changed at Middletons, maybe new kitchen staff, but I won’t be going back there in a hurry. Sort it out Middletons !!!"

Decor very nice, staff were welcoming, accommodating and knowledgeable of the menu. They had an excellent house red wine at a very reasonable £16 / bottle. I think their strongest point is that they have lots of steak options for the steak enthusiast, but they also did very good platters of steak, chicken and lamb and others (I seen to recall king prawns being on the menu) - I thought that made it very interesting. I'm also a big fan of onion rings, theirs had a great texture to their batter, it almost gave it a chewier texture -it really worked"

I ordered Waldorf salad with salmon.... so drenched in mayonnaise I could not taste anything else so couldn’t eat it.  Husband had burger which itself was ok but the bun was like a cheap supermarket bun.  He received the same amount of chips as our 2 year old.

google_mybusiness,nld,1,food;service;reputation,"Perfecte ervaring. We hebben ons laten verrassen door dit etablissement op de dijk van Oostende. Er was een vriendelijk onthaal (je wordt gevraagd om even te wachten voor zelf plaats te nemen), leuke menu kaart met veel uitleg en achteraan enkele weetjes en je krijgt de tijd om rustig te kiezen uit de vele mogelijkheden. De verdere bediening was zeer correct en vriendelijk, en niet onbelangrijk: lekkere drank en perfecte burgers. Zowel wat tussen het broodje steekt, als het broodje zelf, wat naar ons gevoel wel eens wordt onderschat in restaurants. Hoe goed een stuk vlees of kip ook kan zijn... bij een broodje dat te oud, hard of zacht is... valt het gerecht in het water. We hopen dat deze ervaring en manier van werken volgehouden wordt tijdens de drukte van de zomermaanden. Bij afrekenen kwam de vraag of alles in orde was. Onze reactie: ""perfect in orde"" werd beantwoord met ""er is altijd ruimte voor verbetering"". Dit geeft ons het gevoel dat Jilles Beer & Burger oprecht zoekt naar wat klanten belangrijk vinden."

google_mybusiness,eng,1,service;food;environment;value;experience;reputation,"So good we came here twice. And we were only in Ghent for 2 days!The first was when we were desperate for lunch after our plan was thrown off because the schedules posted on another restaurant's online description were misleading.Although they were about to close at Bavet, they managed to squeeze us in with a takeaway order and let us sit on the terrace and enjoy the views of the river.Then we came back for dinner the next day and enjoyed the full experience (beer, pasta, cheesecake).Some things that stood out to me:-They do a classic in a fun and delicious way. We had the Kenny Phoenix mix of sauces and added meatballs and it was so so good. -The staff were friendly and fast; the menu is customizable. You can choose your personal mix of pasta and sauce and toppings. You can choose a size based on how hungry you are (we shared a ""horse"").-This particular location has a romantic terrace which is a lovely place to watch the sunset. Plus, I loved the classic Italian decor (red and white checked, etc).-The cheesecake was a lovely texture with a surprising mix of mango sauce and chocolate cookie topping.-I did find the entrees a little weird mix with spaghetti (Nachos, haloumi, BUT NO GARLIC BREAD?!), but I suppose it's good to have variety.Overall a lovely experience and a very full belly."

Jokes aside, we received the wrong order twice, there was not one server assigned to our table, but apparently several, which made it super confusing. We had to wait for a long time to be noticed and served. When we asked to pay for the first time, we weren't told to go inside (which at this price is more than a little unexpected), so we waited outside for someone to show up with a check and my friend got sunburnt because we weren't told to go inside. Overall, while the food was maybe a little overpriced, the service was unlike anything I've ever seen before (not in a positive sense). The restaurant wasn't even that full and there were many vacant tables."

However I would like to point out that these hardworking, friendly, passionate barista's and chef's should be tipped. There is no tip jar/cup/box or what have you to show your appreciation for their service. When asked about this matter I was told that this is not a policy within vascobelo. You are only as good as how you treat your employees. I think this is a matter to be addressed and acted on swiftly. Kind regards"

And he says that the grill is broken and they are waiting for a technician to have a look.....And we are waiting for 40min, kids starving, without any notice...Technical problems occur and are understandable but the service was unacceptable."

The waitress approached us and took the beverage order and told us we couldn’t order food yet as we would have to wait for the other tables who were there first to order... As in: if the others are not too sure you might be here for a while.Because it was raining we decided to wait a bit. About 20 minutes later we were finally allowed to order.It then took another 30 minutes to be served. Taking into account we ordered burgers and fries and that the restaurant wasn’t even half full it was a long wait. Fortunately the food was ok. The beef used in the burger was delicious, the rest was ok, but certainly not worth the wait of almost an hour in whole. I will not come back. There are better burgers and service in other parts of the city."

It's very casual, and you just pay one price for your meal, then you can enjoy anything on the table - apples, water, little candies, etc.However, I unfortunately was a bit disappointed. The mashed potatoes were bland and boring. The price (€10 for takeaway or €14 for dine-in), while reasonable compared to many sit-down restaurants, still felt quite expensive for just one large meatball and a side. Lastly, I thought the ""Balls and Glory"" theme was overdone and crass for my tastes - the underwear on the wall is what took it too far for me.If it sounds appealing, feel free to check out this restaurant for yourself.

I came here really often to study and work while having a coffee, but today he interrupted me cause he found a snack wrapping on my notebook from a snack that I ate before. He took the small wrapping and told me that I should never bring something like this in there. I told him that I already order coffees and cake form Cofee Company (which were next to me btw). However, he was that rude to tell me that he didn't care and that I'm not even allowed to eat my snacks there. Intruding guests' privacy is worst than eating a small snack while drinking your coffee. Plus, he just saw the wrapping of something that I had before. Imagine if he actually saw me eat my chocolate bar. Never again there."

She said that it was her colleague’s problem and we asked for the other server. She then started to yell at us and try to insult us saying that we were complaining about a 15 euro burger. My husband told her we wanted to ask the other server as it was obvious she wasn’t going to help and she escalated the incident and threatened to throw us out and call the police.  She probably was having a bad day but she made a terrible experience for us.

google_mybusiness,eng,-1,service,"Extremely rude, impolite and aggressive female waiter - manager of the restaurant - Karina CoraiBaca which effectively harassed us to the limit. For some context and better understanding, the restaurant is located in Place Jourdan best known in Brussels for Maison Antoine located the middle of the square which is one of the 2 oldest friteries priding with the best you can eat Belgian fries. There is an unwritten rule that you can serve the fries on all the terraces while ordering beer or something from the restaurants. This being said, we were 2 persons, I went to buy the fries (there are very long waiting ques usually) and my companion took a seat on the terrace of Ellis to order burgers and some drinks - important to mention that we talk about the terrace located in the middle of the square, across the road and not the terrace located on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Upon my return, drinks were already served and in less than 5 minutes a server brings the burgers. Seeing that we had the fries from Maison Antoine, he kindly informs us of the policy of Ellis that they don't allow their customers to buy and consume fries from somewhere else but as the burgers are served he is kind enough to make a joke and agrees to make an exception this time. Less than 5 minutes and the manager arrives informing us she is in charge and despite having the approval of her colleague waiter, we have to pack our fries in order to continue eating. Needless to say we were both enjoying the burgers up to that moment which lasted for another 5 minutes of intense debate during which we acknowledged the strict policy of the restaurant but as we were not informed before ordering, we asked to be left to finish our dinner in peace. Finally after several times asking, the lady visibly irritated by the fact that we did not agree to leave or pack our fries stormed out saying we'll pay a supplement. Of course our appetite was dead and asked for the check immediately. Having to pay inside by the counter (rule of the restaurant) I had to deal with the manager again as she tried to force me pay an extra amount of 3 Euros because not ordering fries from them with the threat that she will call the police if I don't agree. Furthermore, we were both called liars several times just because we did not order fries from the restaurant and were informed that we are no longer welcome there. Thanks a lot Ellis Gourmet Burger for the nice treatment of your customers, it was indeed one different and never to forget experience."

google_mybusiness,eng,1,reputation;food;service,"One of the finest burger places at the Belgian coast.Located at the seafront it's absolutely great to watch the sun set and enjoy a great burger with a great beach side atmosphere.The menu caters to both carnivores, vegetarians and vegans. The menu also has a small selection for kids.With each burger the menu offers a helpful  selection of recommended beers. Burger prices are very steep if compared to prices at  a golden arches fast food chain, but you get much more than the tasteless bun and third grade meat. Here buns are  premium bread and sizeable, and the burgers, both meat and non meat versions are distinguishably of a premium quality. The burger itself is accompanied by a jar of mayolike based apple and other vegetable mix- interesting concept. This might not be to everyone's liking though- as the traditional way of serving burgers in Belgian would be with a larger salad and fries- at a comparable price. If you want fries, they cost  extra, but worth it-though one portion per two people would for most people be enough (large hand cut , baked in grease, yet not over-greasy and perfectly crunchy and soft in all the right places).As to drinks, as mentioned they have a very satisfying selection of beers that are matched with the burgers, as well as tasty home made jar served lemonades.Places fill up quickly on sunny evenings so come early or call ahead. Service is generally friendly and accommodating, however...On the down side, every single table around us was served a wrong order.  Clearly the order system, though seemingly  hi-tech with mobile devices and special buzzing watches, was no match for the sunny summer evening crowd. Double check your bill when paying as we did not receive all the orders we made, yet were charged for them. The non-supplied orders were deducted once pointed out, as was the case with the people around us.When leaving I was stopped non-discretely at the exit and asked whether I had not forgotten to pay,  by the same waiter I had paid to at the cash register five minutes earlier. Again, after a verification in the system, a technical mistake apparently- though a waiter should at least remember a paying client's face for more than five minutes... Order mixups, being billed for non delivered food, being stopped  from leaving in public and asked to pay when one has just paid to the same waiter- these are all mistakes which should not occur in an establishment which clearly has put in effort to bring  an impressive menu with quality food in an otherwise pleasant setting to those willing to pay premium prices for premium food.Despite the downsides, definitely a place I will be revisiting with my colleagues and friends, and hopefully this time without the technical and human glitches in the system..."

Wie viele anderen Gäste, gingen auch wir unser Besteck an ihrer Bar selbst holen, da die Bedienung mit anderem beschäftigt war. Die Menükarte haben wir vom Nachbartisch genommen. Als wir gehen wollten weil wir zu lange warten mussten, kamen dann unsere Burger, die viel zu teuer sind für das was sie sind. Kann keinem empfehen dahin zu gehen."

Na nog een kwartier komt weer de ENIGE serveerster naar ons toe dat ze maar helemaal geen bestellingen meer opnemen. Ze kunnen de drukte niet aan, wat raar is aangezien alle tafeltjes van hun zijn.

instagram,rus,1,environment,"Feeling like Italian today🍝 Со мной приключилась забавная ситуация, которой хочу поделиться с вами🤓 ситуация житейская, и, пожалуй, будет интересна тем, кто подумывает о жизни заграницей. Открываю изнанку, так сказать😄Я уже почти 2 года живу в Бельгии и сменила двух арендодателей жилья.  Сперва, я снимала комнату как студент. Позднее начала подрабатывать (сидеть с детьми) у одной итальянско-русской семьи. В Бельгии, как и в любой другой стране Евросоюза, очень строго с документами - обязательно должен быть контракт, заплачен депозит за 1/2 месяца, чтобы подтвердить легальность проживания и чистоту оплаты налогов. Позднее, когда я стала сидеть с детьми на постоянной основе, мне предложили вариант снятия маленькой студии прям под домом, то бишь в подвальном помещении. К тому времени, у моих арендодателей случилась неприятности и они сказали, что жильё будет продаваться, что означало - мне предстояли поиски нового жилья. Это самый настоящий кошмар, можно сказать эпопея. А тут итальянцы подвернулись со своим «выгодным» на тот момент предложением, уверяя, что сделают отличную цену и вообще все будут счастливы, ведь мне будет легче работать. Я согласилась, но через какое-то время, всё обернулось совсем не так, как я рассчитывала...🙈#mybelgianexperience🇧🇪#belgianlife#photography#belgium#adventuresofalifetime#lifeintechnicolor#vsco#vscocam#bavet#italian#foodporn"

Our greatest apologies that the experience of your visit wasn't quite what you expected. You've pointed out some major key points where ‘Bavet’ wants to stand out! As we can read, the service was slow; that’s a pity, because we are fast-casual! 20 minutes waiting time to have drink is just not done! Next to that you didn’t wear the bib, that’s even worse, because you know; we are Bavet. And we’re not responsible for stains on your shirt!��By missing those key points with your visit it’s not a surprise that your visit wasn’t a great experience.��We have to say that our main host at Chaussée de Boondael is in holiday, but that’s not an excuse! Next to this all, we are following-up on the points you mentioned! This with the people that were serving that night.Again, our greatest apologies. We’re pretty sure that your next visit will give you a whole other experience! That’s why we want to invite you for a free dinner.

Neen de reden waarom ik er wegblijf is omdat het er zo lawaaierig is dat ik er meestal met hoofdpijn buiten kom.  Heerlijk eten maar niet HSP vriendelijk.

formitable,nld,1,service,"Een deel van ons gezelschap had vertraging maar dat was geen enkel probleem. Zeer vriendelijke en behulpzame bediening en geen te lange wachttijden. Echter kleine kaart, op zich geen probleem, maar dan zou er binnen de beperkte keuze toch wat meer variatie mogen zijn. Te weinig vis naar mijn mening en een of twee streekbieren ontbreken zeker nog! Zeker met een lokale brouwerij aan de overkant van de straat..."

Lekker eten, leuk decor, prima bediening, ...Twee kleine tips ter verbetering:Wij kregen de niet alcoholische aperitief 'Jeaninneke' (die zeer goed was) aangeboden met olijven. Dat was ons inziens geen al te beste combinatie.Mayo afzonderlijk aanrekenen zouden we ook niet doen. Vraag gewoon iets meer voor het hoofdgerecht.Verder succes toegewenst"
formitable,nld,1,service;food;experience,"Na een fikse wandeling, inclusief de heuvel achter de brasserie, genoten van een lekkere schotel.  Ondanks een vol terras toch snelle én supervriendelijke bediening.  Het eten was erg lekker.  Als het wat frisser werd, werd er spontaan rondgegaan met fleece dekentjes. Ook leuk is de kaart, opgesteld in het plaatselijk dialect, creëert direct een ontspannen sfeer !Klein puntje: als je 10 km gaat wandelen is het krap om voor 20:15 terug te zijn, in de zomer de keuken misschien een uurtje langer openhouden."

Het eten (veggie ovenschotel) was zeer lekker. Een beetje spijtig dat er niet een volwaardige vleesvervanger in zat, bv. tofu. Het pick nickterras is een goed idee voor als we in het bos gaan wandelen. Het was spijtig dat we om 22:30u al naar huis moesten. Iets later open blijven zou nog beter zijn, vooral op warme zomerse dagen. De kaart zou nog iets uitgebreider mogen met wat meer slaatjes, bv een veggieslaatje met linzen, quorn of seitan, enkele mocktails en alcoholvrije aperitieven zou ik ook appreciëren, en iets anders 'zero' dan alleen maar cola, bv. fanta zero, sprite zero of ice tea zero.

google_mybusiness,fra,-1,service;environment;food,"Que dire?  Nous avons déjà attendu 25 minutes avant que l'un serveur ne nous apporte les cartes. Celles-ci, sont plutôt mal fichues puisque très longues (espèces de livres avec 3 burgers par pages et je ne sais combien d'espèces de burgers différents) Autant vous dire que lorsqu' on arrive à la fin du menu, on a déjà oublié tous les burgers qui étaient avant. De nouveau,  très longue attente avant la prise de la commande. Étant en plein soleil, sous 32°, sans parasol,  nous demandons pour pouvoir être déplacés à l'intérieur.  Fort gentiment (raison de mon unique étoile),  le serveur accepte et nous place près de la fenêtre. Mais là,  horreur,  l'intérieur du restaurant-non climatisé- est infesté de mouches. On nous apporte nos burgers qui, de toute évidence ont été cuits, re-cuits et re-re-cuits. D'ailleurs,  ce n'est pas étonnant puisque le serveur ne nous a pas demandé quelle type de cuisson nous désirions. Parmi nous, une personne allergique aux tomates avait demandé que son burger n'en contienne pas en contient, bien évidement.  Les mini-burgers des enfants,durs comme du bois, sont dans des pains secs et trop cuits. Et pour les menus adultes, les frites sont en supplément. Seul petit point positif, la petite salade de chou et de pommes qui accompagne tous les burgers.Le tout pour une addition de 109€ pour 4 adultes et 2 enfants.  Bref, je ne peux que vous déconseiller d'y aller."

Personeel wist niet wat eerst doen en bovendien geen leiding. Jammer dat dit concept kwantiteit boven kwaliteit zet. Men kan hier zoveel meer uithalen mits goede begeleiding.

google_mybusiness,eng,-1,service;food;value,"I went with a couple of friends on a Tuesday evening. One of my friends, and I, are vegan, while the other one is not. We went in and I wasn’t sure if it is self service or not. The guy behind the cash said hello and After greeting him back, i asked if we can sit down and if we should order next to the cash or if he would come to our table. He said we can sit and he is coming. We sat down and after 15 mins of waiting, no one came to our table. We changed the table(due to the heat) and after another 10mins, still no one came to serve us. BEAR IN MIND, we were sitting inside and although outside was busy, there was only ONE other table with customers inside and most of the waiters were just making jokes behind the bar. Finally we decided to go directly to the cash and order ourselves. When the food came, we were pretty underwhelmed! Me and my vegan friend had the beyond meat burger of course(since it’s the only vegan option) and our non vegan friend had a meat burger. The portion was pretty small and the burgers came without any sides. The sweet potato fries we had ordered at the side were €4.50 each while the beyond burgers were around €12 each. I know it’s supposedly a ‘gourmet’ restaurant according to its name but it’s still too expensive for what you get! After we were done eating, we were left with our plate on the table for another 15mins and we just decided to pay and leave cause we were too disappointed. We went to the cash to pay our bill, which also took a very long time because the workers were chatting with each other. Although I love and appreciate the initiative of adding a vegan option to such a place, I was very disappointed with the service and their prices!"

google_mybusiness,nld,-1,food;service,"Gisteren heb ik ontbeten bij vascobelo Eindhoven voor de eerste keer. Ik heb een geweldige ervaring gehad. Super service en een leuke, vriendelijke jongedame die mij geserveerd heeft. Deze ervaring wilde ik graag delen met mijn vriendin uit Utrecht. Bij binnenkomst liepen we langs de counter en mijn vriendin vond het opmerkelijk dat wij niet gegroet werden maar deze jongedame leek druk met broodjes snijden dus ik zei mijn vriendin dat ze ons vast niet heeft opgemerkt. Mijn vriendin is nogal van de service en dit soort dingen storen haar al snel. Na het opnemen van onze bestelling (2 vascobelo ontbijt met ei) kregen we dit al gauw op tafel. De croissantjes waren enorm hard en niet warm. Mijn vriendin heeft dit aangegeven maar dit werd niet gewaardeerd. De arrogante houding van de medewerkster was vreselijk. Ze gaf aan dat er niks aan gedaan kan worden en we dezelfde (verbrande croissant opnieuw kunnen krijgen) vond ik erg apart maar ze pleurt met een attitude het bord op tafel en loopt arrogant weg. Wij waren in shock. Geen enkele excuses of tegemoetkoming. Absurd.Dit heeft de ochtend negatief beïnvloed want wij voelde ons totaal niet welkom.Wij hebben circa 50 euro afgerekend voor een onbijtje met bagger service on the side. Laatste keer in Utrecht, helaas!!! Wij zullen niet gauw meer terugkeren en wij vinden het erg spijtig. Eindhoven is wel geweldig! Zeker een aanrader."

google_mybusiness,nld,-1,service,Ik vond het jammer dat we niet achteraan mochten zitten in de zaak. Daar is het mooi om te zitten. Vandaar werden we in het midden van de zaak geplaatst. Resultaat is dat de tafels zeer dicht bij elkaar staan en we eigenlijk naast een ander koppel zaten die een gevoelig gesprek voerden. Dit konden we niet anders dan aanhoren. Dit zorgde eigenlijk voor een raar gevoel daar ik eigenlijk dit totaal niet wenste te aanhoren. Gedurende de tijd zat achteraan volledig leeg... wel jammer dat we dus daar niet in rust konden zitten.

Choice beef, lamb or pork with vegetables and huge Yorkshire pudding, gravy. £10.95 each. They have vegetarian option. Clean comfortable seating. Excellent waiters/waitresses overseeing everything. Cintila red wine was very welcome as was the bottle water placed on table as we sat down. Food was delicious. Full of flavour. Thoroughly recommend this place.

facebook,eng,1,food;service;environment,"I have attended Granite Links for an engagement brunch and dined at the Tavern before with both experiences being wonderful. I just attended and participated as a bridesmaid in a wedding at Granite Links for the first time this weekend. The venue itself is stunning, and the outdoor view of Boston is simply beautiful and breathtaking. The passed hors d'oeuvres were all delicious, and the servers were all very patient and kind with many hungry wedding guests bombarding them all for food. The haddock with mashed potatoes and asparagus for dinner was very filling and tasty as well. The event personnel leads were all friendly, nice, and accommodating. One server, Mark, went above and beyond with his customer service and professionalism for me. Thank you so much to him as he really was amazing! However, I did experience a rather unpleasant exchange with one of the servers who spoke to me in a very condescending manner after I simply asked a question; this left a bad taste in my mouth prior to dinner. If Facebook still had the star rating systems for reviews, I would give 3 stars for that very reason. I did not want to provide any constructive feedback on my friends' wedding day as I felt it was not the appropriate time and place, but I am passing this feedback on now in hopes that this can be improved in the future. I can elaborate more via direct message or e-mail if necessary."

Helaas kwamen wij van een koude kermis thuis, de manier hoe wij hier door het personeel zijn behandeld is ronduit schandalig. Toen wij informeerden naar waarom er botten in de 'boneless' chicken zaten, werd ons geen blik waardig gegund en vroegen wij om verdere uitleg - we hebben later geleerd dat een 'boneless' chicken erg moeilijk te maken is. Toen de ober het gesprek tussen ons overhoorde dat wij ontevreden waren, besloot hij plots het gerecht van tafel te pakken en ons te melden dat we dan maar ergens anders moesten gaan eten. Dit alles zonder enig fatsoenlijk overleg tussen personeel en klant, iets wat ronduit schandalig is.Dikke afrader dus!"

Tafel stond nog vol van borden e.d. van de vorige eters. Dit op den duur maar zelf weg gezet op een andere volle tafel. Daarna werd ons vriendelijk verzocht naar een zeer klein tafeltje te gaan zodat 3 andere mensen aan onze tafel konden zitten. Oke dan. Na een tijd werd dan een waterkan gelukkig al gebracht maar niet onze bestelling van drank. Een tijd later kregen we ons eten. Helaas viel dit ook tegen. De gehaktbal was erg droog en zag nog roze van binnen. Ook de stoemp was weinig gekruid . Geen peper en zout op tafel. Na ons eten ( maar de helft op helaas) gelijk afgerekend.

Quick and friendly service.TGI Fridays is my favourite restaurant. Especially when I visit in Edinburgh, the only thing I find disappointing is not as much to offer as the UK restaurants."

formitable,nld,-1,service;environment;food,"De iPad waar we gebruik van maakte functioneerde niet naar behoren. We hebben een aantal keren op de service knop gedrukt maar dan kwam er niemand. We moesten alsnog zelf opletten en iemand naar ons toe wenken, erg vervelend. Het idee van elke vrijdag avond live muziek is leuk, echter was het veel te rumoerig. De muziek stond te hard en er waren te veel achtergrondgeluiden waardoor we elkaar amper konden verstaan. Verder was het eten en drinken prima."
formitable,nld,-1,food,De mac en cheese was helemaal niet lekker en lijkt in de verste vette niet op de amerikaanse versie. Buffalo wings erg lekkerLoaded aardappel met pulled beef ook lekker.De spare ribs wel oke maar niet te vergelijken met de amerikaans ed versie. Ik zou ze niet nog een keer bestellen

formitable,nld,-1,food;service,"Eten was koud, friet koud. Een van ons besloot het eten maar op te eten  en de frites terug te sturen. Frites werden teruggebracht toen ie klaar was met eten. Chickenwings waren gewoon koud, teruggestuurd. Chickenwings worden diepgefrituurd zijn smaakloos, vet en sauce wordt letterlijk overheen gegoten. Obers staan maar te staan terwijl 7 mensen aan het eten waren in het restaurant. Dit restaurant is niet waardig om het naam van TGIF te dragen. 100 km gereden om speciaal daar te eten gezien ervaringen met het keten in het buitenland en één teleurstelling rijker."

Locatie leuk.Te gehorig en rumoerig, muziek te hard, geen zicht op onze tafel mbt afruimtijd enz, prijzen te hoog in verhouding met wat je krijgt.  Entree smoezelig. Voor hetzelfde geld ga je in een heel goed eetcafé eten met veel betere omstandigheden. Als dit geheel op 60 % van de prijs zat zou ik het wel in verhouding vinden."

Bij aankomst kregen we tafel, na navraag en verzoek kregen we een hogere tafel, maar dit was niet helemaal relaxed voor/met een kind van 3. Nooit eerder een probleem geweest, bij aankomst genoeg booths vrij, dus we zagen het probleem niet helemaal. De reden die we kregen was dat de plek ‘niet gegarandeerd kon worden’. Jammer."

Het personeel is erg vriendelijk (spreekt soms enkel Engels maar ach, hoort bij het plaatje ;-)). De burger met schijnbaar beroemde saus was MEGA lekker en ook de patat was echt super! Goede locatie direct op CS. Had alleen graag aan het raam gezeten bij de treinen, maar dat deel van het restaurant was dicht omdat het niet zo heel druk was (maar wel gezellig druk :-))."
formitable,nld,-1,food;service,"De rest van de tafel was erg tevreden over zijn eten, maar mijn vegetarische burger was niet goed. Koud en de structuur was raar. Keurig van de rekening gehaald. Daarnaast besloot de ober om een rondje bier om te gooien, waardoor mijn schoenen doornat waren en nu stinken naar bier. Die kan ik dus weg gooien. Al met al een matige ervaring!"
formitable,nld,-1,experience;service;environment,"Met vrienden hier neergestreken voor een diner. We zijn hier al een paar keer geweest en het is een mooi/leuk restaurant met lekker eten. We hadden de sparribs die overigens wel erg veel gemarineers zijn en veel saus hebben.  Wederom was het personeel niet zo attent; drankjes vergeten, een verkeerd item wat op tafel kwam wat we niet besteld hadden. De ober bevestigde dit, maar nam verder niet de moeite te zorgen dat dit ook niet op de rekening vermeld werd. Verder was de drankenkaart op tafel te vies om beet te pakken. Hier is toch wel vooruitgang te boeken."
formitable,nld,1,service;food;environment,"Het eten was lekker, de sfeer is goed en de bediening goed. Het voorgerecht duurde deze keer wel iets lang. Het eten is ook allemaal wel vet, maar dat komt natuurlijk ook door de stijl. Voornaamste tip: de rietjes, alhoewel leuk en in stijl, zijn van papier, waardoor ze slap worden na verloop van tijd. Zeker als je een drankje hebt waarin je met je rietje wil kunnen roeren, is dat dus niet handig."
formitable,nld,1,service;food,Goede service en heerlijk eten!
formitable,nld,1,environment;service,"Echt goed gegeten, met het gevoel dat je redelijk privé zat. Erg prettige bediening. Jammer dat er bij de hoofdgerechten bijna 10 minuten zat tussen eerste en laatste gerecht op tafel. Bij nagerecht was dit nog veel meer."
formitable,nld,-1,food,Heel eeg jammer. Maar de sparibs was super stijf en viel totaal niet van het botje. Dus ik heb dit aangegeven en ik wacht rustig tot ze weer de juiste sparibs hebben. Want als het wel van het botje afvalt zijn ze super super lekker.
formitable,nld,0,value;environment,"Na een prettige ontvangst door de dame aan de deur, een verwelkomend gesprek met de serveerster was de kaart wel een uitdaging... Zoveel lekkers, wil ik gewoon de tafel vol zetten met voorgerechten of moet er ook nog een hoofd gerecht bij passen?Tegen het dessert kwam er live muziek bij. Dat was een beduidend minder succesvol initiatief. Gelukkig moesten we weg maar de zangeres zou voor ons reden geweest zijn om ons bezoek eerder af te kappen."
formitable,eng,-1,food,We wanted to eat ribs and there were no ribs; bread in my sandwich was very hard; coleslaw was not tasty at all
formitable,nld,1,value;food;service,"Ik vond dat mijn voor gerecht veel te groot was waardoor ik bijna geen zin meer had in mijn hoofdgerecht, heb ook niet alles opgegeten van het hoofdgerecht. Verder is het gewoon top wij zijn vorig jaar een week na de opening geweest maar nu was het veel beer geregeld allemaal en nu kwam het eten ook normaal door vorige keer hebben we 1,5 uur moeten wachten op het hoofdgerecht en nu niet. Het is dat we langer als een uur moeten rijden anders zou ik véél vaker komen eten"

formitable,nld,-1,service,"Normaliter worden we direct ontvangen door de persoon die ons de gehele avond zal bedienen, dit maal was dat niet het geval. Ook moesten we zelf vragen of we wat te drinken mochten bestellen. Later nogmaals drinken besteld, wat niet uitgeserveerd werd - en waar we om moesten vragen. Helaas was het niet de service die we van jullie gewend zijn, net nu we mijn ouders uit enthousiasme hadden meegenomen. Jammer."
formitable,nld,1,consistency;food;service,"Elke keer als we er komen is het personeel erg vriendelijk. Gisteren geweest, we hadden dezelfde middag nog gereserveerd maar waren iets later, we hadden gebeld en de jongen aan de telefoon zei dat dat geen probleem was en hij heeft onze reservering een kwartiertje verzet. De keuken miste een personeelslid ivm ziekte, dit werd netjes bij ons aangegeven (dat het eten misschien iets langer zou duren) des ondanks was het eten er prima optijd en even lekker als altijd. Mijn complimenten!"
formitable,nld,1,food;value;experience;service,"De cali fried chicken was vrij smaakloos, maar het broodje en de groente etc was wel lekker. Ook hadden we een entrecote. Niet medium, maar wel nog best lekker en die friday’s saus was ook heel lekker. De frietjes waren top en het was erg leuk dat we flessen saus kregen ipv een klein portie! De kaart en de inrichting zagen er super leuk uit en de dagelijkse deals zijn ook top. Op de bediening was ook niets aan te merken, gewoon prima."
formitable,nld,-1,food;service,"Wij willen hier al heen sinds de opening. In Madrid hebben wij heerlijk gegeten bij Fridays. Helaas was het niet zoals we gewend zijn. We hebben langer dan verwacht moeten wachten tot ons drinken werd opgenomen en nog langer tot het gebracht werd. Het voorgerecht was verkeerd, maar dit was te overzien. Toen kwam het hoofdgerecht, iets waar we erg naar uitkeken. Maar helaas was de Carolina Crispy Chicken erg droog en kregen geen van ons 3 een hap naar binnen, maar verdwenen die in de servetten.  Ook de top Sirloin steak was enorm droog en niet naar binnen te krijgen. Het enige wat we goed naar binnen kregen waren de Pork Ribs, de mashed patatoes en de coleslaw. Heel jammer, vooral omdat we anderhalf uur gereden hebben speciaal om hier te eten. Dit doen we niet meer."
formitable,nld,-1,environment;value,"TGI Fridays is snel en efficient en redelijk gezellig. Muziek staat iets te hard. Drankjes etc. bestellen via tablet/app is raar, maar het werkt. Spareribs waren helaas niet bbq maar gebakken en dus iets te vet. TGI is in verhouding iets te duur voor de geboden kwaliteit in vergelijking met dat andere spareribs-restaurant in Utrect-Centrum.Op de een of andere manier zijn TGI's in USA toch steeds beter ..."

Leuk om te delen met een groep maar zeker geen ""Starters"" oftewel voorgerechten te noemen. Het halve portie zou daar al meer dan genoeg voor zijn. Het hoofgerecht was niet bijzonder. De crispy chicken burger ziet er mooi uit op het plaatje maar in het echt is hij vrij karig belegd en droog helaas. De bediening was ook vreemd. Drinken bestellen via tablet en eten wel bij de bediening. Knopje om service te vragen op tablet werkt niet (of wordt in ieder geval niet opgevolgd). Dan maar drinken bestellen zodat er in ieder geval iemand naar de tafel komt. Maar dat is natuurlijk weer niet iemand die eten mag opnemen. Concept werkt in Amerika, zolang er maar actief wordt bediend en gelet op de wensen van de gast."

google_mybusiness,eng,-1,experience;service,"Great cocktails - I’ll give it that. Then it all went downhill. Arrived at around 8 pm, put our names down for a table / seats for 2, and ordered drinks to have whilst waiting. We weren’t given a waiting time which really is quid pro quo for such restaurants that take no reservations, which was honestly fine. What was NOT fine - at 9 pm i saw that there were 3 empty tables in the restaurant, so I asked the waitress how many names were ahead of us on the waiting list. She said we were the second on the list. I asked, “oh okay, there are 3 empty tables, please could we be seated?” She said she will, please wait. Fast forward 20 minutes later, and the tables were still empty. I am not sure why we couldn’t have been seated earlier, even just to have our drinks - we had ordered our second round so it’s not as if we weren’t paying. Were we kept standing outside just to create “vibe”? Anyway after more than 90 minutes of standing outside in full view of the waitress, we were finally seated. Ordered some form of croquettes, tuna ceviche and octopus salad and garlic prawns. Garlic prawns never came. First three items painfully average - tuna soggy in the way that frozen and thawed fish is - not what I’d consider appropriate for ceviche. Octopus salty and devoid of flavour (apart from salty.) All in all food that is definitely not worth a 90 minute wait. There are tonnes of better places to eat in Lisbon. The people queuing outside the restaurant are kept there for a reason. Do not trust the vibe."

Each table is given crispy chips and French onion dip- a total slam dunk!!! I ordered the lobster roll (a special) and was not super impressed, but overall good. Made on a crispy bun that reminds me of the texture of Texas toast, the sandwich was stuffed full of decent lobster. It did not have much flavor though. The sweet potato fries (that I ordered for an up charge) were the shining star of my meal. The coleslaw was also pretty good- not too much mayo.Overall fun place to go, maybe don't order the lobster roll? Sweet potatoes were definitely awesome."

Damn, what a horrible phrase. Strike it from the record.It's true, though - a massive full-service restaurant and bar with a killer al fresco scene overlooking the namesake driving range and those looking to pummel it with buckets of ballsThe first time we came here, we made a huge mistake and sat inside. If the weather permits, you have to plop it outdoors, friendo - it's a game changer for the experience, as the food was hit or miss. Same with cocktails; solid beer list with a lot of local stuff.Almost always busy but the staff and kitchen cans handle a massive crowd, so don't be intimidated.

formitable,nld,0,service;food,Over het algemeen is de kwaliteit van de gerechten in orde. Toch wat verbeterpunten:* De vleesgerechten zijn te zout.* Kartonnen rietjes in een milkshake (dessert) werken niet (ze worden slap voordat de milkshake op is).* De rekening! Graag overhandigen en later terugkomen om af te rekenen (zodat de klant kan controleren en nadenken over een eventuele fooi). Blijven staan met de pinautomaat in de aanslag stel ik niet op prijs en kostte je je fooi.* Meer keuze in kwaliteitswijnen per glas zou ik waarderen.

De bon moesten we afgeven aan degene die ons bediende, ze keek echter verbaasd/raar toen we de bon afgaven. Vervolgens kwamen voor- en hoofdgerecht tegelijkertijd. Broodje met kip lag in de saus dus was één grote, zompige chaos. Aan het einde de rekening netjes betaald waarna we thuis erachter kwamen dat we de korting niet hadden gehad. Hier verschillende keren een mail over gestuurd, gebeld, naar de internationale klantenservice gemaild die ons weer naar de nationale klantenservice stuurde. En nu, een paar maanden later nog steeds geen klacht kunnen indienen hierover. Vooral ergerlijk omdat we zelfs een review hebben achtergelaten op Google en meerdere mensen zo wel contact kregen met iemand van de klantenservice maar wij nog steeds niet. Oftewel het maakt ze eigenlijk allemaal geen hol uit. Het gaat niet om het geld, maar wel om het principe! Als je geen korting wilt/kunt geven, biedt het dan ook niet aan.(Translated by Google)Last April we had dinner with two people. Reserved after 8.30 p.m. so received a (self-torn) voucher with a 15% discount. We had to hand over the receipt to the person who served us, but she looked surprised / weird when we issued the receipt. Then the starter and main course arrived at the same time. Chicken sandwich lay in the sauce so there was one big, swampy chaos. At the end the bill was paid properly, after which we discovered at home that we had not had the discount. Sent an email about this several times, called, emailed to the international customer service who sent us back to the national customer service. And now, a few months later still not able to submit a complaint about this. Especially annoying because we even left a review on Google and several people got in touch with someone from customer service but we still haven't. In other words, it doesn't really matter to them all. It's not about the money, it's about the principle! If you do not want to / cannot give a discount, then it does not offer."

formitable,nld,0,food;service;innovation,"Het eten was goed, onion ringslang en ribs waren goed van smaak en sappig. Het personeel heeft daarentegen geen kaas gegeten van service, bij binnenkomst was de hostess er niet, maar stond er 6 man aan personeel duimen te draaien zonder ons een blik waardig te gunnen. Gedurende de maaltijd werd dit niet beter, lege glazen en flesjes verzamelden zich in grote getale op de tafel en alleen bij gebrek aan ruimte werd het hoogst nodige van tafel meegenomen. Bij het afrekenen leek niemand het geld te willen ontvangen. De tablet om te bestellen lijkt een excuus om contact met de gast tot een absoluut minimum te beperken, maar deze is niet volledig ingericht waardoor er geen specials in staan en eten ook persoonlijk besteld moet worden."
formitable,nld,1,service;food;environment;convenience,"Het eten was voortreffelijk. We hebben gesmuld.De bediening was minder. Lang wachten en steeds een ober wenken voor de volgende stap.De wijze waarop het eten geserveerd werd was minder.

Also, the doneness of the meat in 2 dishes were swapped. The person with allergies ordered a medium rare steak, but got the well done one. The other person was able to send the medium rare steak back to the kitchen for more cooking. The food itself was fine."

Er word zelf moeite gedaan om de beleving Amerikaans te laten aanvoelen, maar ook weer niet te veel. Een echte aanrader, spijtig voor ons veel te ver om vaak te doen. Laat maar snel een TGI's dichter bij België openen."
formitable,nld,-1,experience;service;food,"Van binnen ziet het groots en modern uit. De voorgerechten waren goed. Daarna ging het mis: Ten eerste kwam de fles bronwater niet aan, ondanks de bestelling via de app. Ten tweede moesten wij veel te lang op het hoofdgerecht wachten, ondanks dat de zaak maar voor 30% gevuld was (2e pinksterdag) om 18.00 uur. Ten derde waren ze onze frietjes vergeten te serveren, voor onze kinderen een essentieel onderdeel van de maaltijd.Maar meest teleurstellend was dat de gerechten van matige kwaliteit waren.  Mijn zoon en ik hadden spareribs. Ondanks dat we grotere porties gewend waren, viel het meest op dat ze gewoon kaal op een bord lagen. De frietjes zaten in een RVS bekertje. Het gerecht zag er zeker niet uit zoals de afbeelding op de menukaart. Ze waren net niet te gaar, maar het zat er tegen aan. Ik vond ze onvoldoende sappig, het ging richting 'doorgekookt'.Mijn dochter had een 'Carolina crispy Chicken"" burger. Deze was met goed fatsoen niet op te eten, het hele pakket van een keihard broodje, een dikke laag 'ingemaakte groente' en een volledige kipfilet deed ons meer aan een stapel voedsel dan aan een burger denken. Dan de kip: Dit was een een geplette kipfilet die in de frituur had gelegen. Hij smaakte meer naar frituurolie dan naar de kruiden die erop zaten.Mijn vrouw had een 'latin roasted chicken', een gesmoorde halve kip. Dat smoren is zeker gelukt, want de vleessappen waren grotendeels verdwenen. Je proefde duidelijk dat dit een 'opgewarmd' product was."
formitable,nld,-1,service,"Vandaag was de 2e keer dat ik bij jullie ben komen eten. Op tijd gereserveerd. Bij de drankjes werden we gauw geholpen. Het eten bestellen ging al wat trager. Eenmaal iemand aangesproken en bestelling opgegeven. Na een halfuur horen we dat mijn gerecht ineens niet meer te bestellen is omdat de mini burgers op zijn. Dan denk ik GAST, was meteen gekomen je laat mensen niet een halfuur wachten! Vervolgens serveren jullie een kindermenu van mijn zoon en van ons 3 volwassen niks gezien. Ik dacht laat ik 15min wachten. Later heb ik een chef aangesproken waar onze eten blijft wacht al meer dan 20 min !!! Dan komt hij met een verkeerde hoofdgerecht voor mij. Beetje jammer van jullie service. En als je de rekening vraagt aan een blonde griet kijkt ze super arrogant. Totaal onvriendelijke blik. Als jullie service op nr1 staat zou je dat graag wel willen terug zien als klant. Maar nee gewone volle pond betalen. Volgens mij is de korting van mijn zoon ook niet verrekend 50% pinksterenactie."

Pedimos desculpa pela experiência menos positiva e gostaríamos de oferecer-lhe uma nova sandes.Utilizamos sempre os ingredientes de maior qualidade em todas as sandes que fazemos.

Clearly it’s obvious trying to save on the lobster by halfing 1 into 2 to save on product. Appalling spent a lot of money here in the past and it has gone down hill massively"

facebook,eng,-1,experience;service;food,I ate here last night for the first time in about a year and a half for my partners birthday and all I can say is it has gone massively down hill. The waiter smashed a glass by accident went all over the food. Then persisted to have a discretion with us about the food rather than apologising and getting on with it then the food came out 2 minutes later and looked like it had been reheated on a new plate. Further to that when I pay 28 pound for a lobster I do not expect half the lobster to be subsidised with a lobster claw because your clearly getting 2 out of 1 lobster. Quite a shame really because I’ve eaten here a hell of a lot and spent good money over the years

The dining area furnishings need serious consideration. Furniture quality was fine, but noise levels were horrendous.  If you have hearing aids  it makes for a very trying evening.

Before the end of our meal they had brought out a plate with ""Happy Birthday"" hand written in chocolate sauce & dotted with mini cakes! I did not ask for this but they it off their own back & made my mother feel even more special for her bug day!Based in what used to be the old Barclay's Bank building, as evidenced when you go to the toilet & the old vault door frames are still in place, this place has some history to it.All in all give this great establishment a visit & I don't think you'll leave disappointed!"

We ordered the seasonal ""the (im)possible bavet"" and a spaghetti based on the ""hot tomato sauce"" 🍅. Both were severely underwhelming, with overcooked pasta so far from al dente it felt more like mush than 🍝. The bavet was under seasoned and lacked spices. The hot tomato was so mild that the ketchup gave it a run for it's money, it also tasted like the tomato base came from a can and it looked like the parmesan came pre-grated in a bag. There was also plenty of water accumulated in the bottom of the bowl, unfortunately I didn't order a minestrone soup. The spaghetti seemed like your run of the mill dry pasta from the supermarket, while dry pasta is fine and can be flavorful and delicious you need to treat it right (like your partner), unlike what this place does."

instagram,por,1,experience;reputation,"À boleia do meu fascínio por pão artesanal tenho conhecido muitas pessoas capazes de nos cativar pela sua humildade e generosidade. Uma dessas pessoas chama-se Paulo Cardoso..Nas próximas semanas vou partilhar por aqui partes da incrível conversa que tivemos à mesa do LAB, onde pcardoso21 passa os seus dias como Chef de Padaria e Pastelaria encarregue pelo Desenvolvimento e Inovação e que está intimamente ligado com o desenvolvimento do negócio d’ apadariaportuguesa.É um dos primeiros colaboradores da Padaria Portuguesa e foi na sua cabeça (sempre ativa) que nasceu o famoso Pão de Deus ""da casa"". Anos depois ao mundo da pastelaria juntou o da Padaria e é através das suas mãos que nasce o pão artesanal feito com farinhas de moleiro que agora podemos levar para casa..O excerto que vos trago hoje é exatamente sobre pão e demonstra, em parte, o que faz do Paulo uma pessoa com quem a Gato não poderia deixar de conversar numa ""mesa de café"": . ""Acho que ao partilhar também estamos de certa forma a evoluir, porque alguém pode pegar no nosso conhecimento e transformar e fazer algo novo e eu só consigo ver benefícios disso. Todos ficamos mais ricos. Quanto mais partilhas mais os outros partilham contigo. Cria-se uma bolha mas feliz em torno das pessoas. Há espaço para todos. O pão não é uma coisa de hoje.

google_mybusiness,eng,-1,food,"Most disgusting vegan meal I’ve ever tasted. The soy-based Mexican burger had the wrong texture, barely any guac, 2 small wedged tomatoes (instead of slices) so they slid off the burger, and was smothered in a nasty ‘cheese’ sauce, and was missing the jalapeños. The baked potato wedges were topped with a sauce For which the only word that comes to mind is rancid. Do your tastebuds and wallet a favor and eat a real vegan meal elsewhere."

google_mybusiness,eng,-1,food,Disappointing. I tried the new greenway burger for 11.80 (doesn’t include a side or drink) and it was like eating a basic frozen vegan meat patty I could have bought at the store for far less. The patty was also kind of cold and the tomatoes on the burger were cut in wedges which seems like an odd choice for a burger as they just kept falling out. Seems like maybe all the great reviews were from when they were still serving Beyond Burgers.

We were told that it was strange and maybe it flew into the salad. It was really difficult to believe that since the insect was found the moment we mixed the salad, which means it was at the bottom of the bowl. We didn't pay for the salad, still it was the biggest disappointment today. Plus there was less caramelised meat than the last burger meatlover we had. We are not harsh, and it's really sad to rate a restaurant you returned to because of the huge contrast..."

google_mybusiness,eng,1,experience;service;food,It was very busy when we went but the waiter wasted no time in pushing a few tables together and we were sat down. All the staff were really polite and friendly. Small things like good manners by stepping out of the way to let you past made a difference. The service was not the quickest but it was worth the wait as the food was spectacular. I had a mixed grill and each bit of meat was cooked perfectly. Yum. Also a big winner was their pina colada. Massive favourite of mine that my mates all rib me for. It tasted better than the ones I had in Antigua! Highly recommend this restaurant.

yelp,eng,-1,food;experience,Beautiful ambience and atmosphere.  Great for friends and a day out with girl or friends.  Noisy and busy.  Now the food.  For Soho the price is reasonable.however I woould not come here for the food.  I am only talking vege food as thats all we had.The Tadka Daal is sub par ( eating while.commemting).  It needed what Indians call Tadka.  It tasted like boil.daal with spices thrown in. I did not like it and wish chef had made better effort. I gave it 2/10.  Edible but not something I'll recommend. The butternut Makhani squash was good. The butternut squash was I think grilled in the tandoor and then Makhani sauce was added. It was good however the Makhani sauce complemented it rather than be part of it. It was good and I old have it just because it is a healthier meal.  Nothing to scream about.  I gave it a 6/10The garlic coriander Naan is good.YOU must order a Naan or rice or you would get just the sauces for dinner.  It is not part of meal. I know for sure that Indian meals have to be had with either Naan read or rice and it boggles my mind when it is not part of a meal. Wish they would just charge a bit more for it and include in meal. However it is what it is. I watched some Caucasians and Black's having the meals without Naan or rice eating them as if they were a dish to be eaten on their own. The wait staff do recommend that you order rice or Naan but!!!!Don't think it's a place I'll.come back to.   Good luck

Checked out, it turned out that they were stuck with many orders in between (you can also pick up / order online), so the waiting time could be up to 40 minutes .. and effectively at 7:40 pm ours had our pasta.

Deserts were poor, custard was cold so got returned. Most of the deserts seemed shop bought rather they made on premises, as they used to be. We complained and got £10 off our bill and a £30 voucher to return again, which they promised would show them in a better light.Today my wife went back to use the voucher for lunch. Vegetables were old, and had to be sent back. Service again was slow (took 2 hours for 2 courses, despite meant to be a quick lunch service)."

There was a discretionary service charge to be added to our bill, mentioned on the menu. We would not normally pay this but had decided to based on the quality of the food. Unfortunately, the time between asking for our bill and actually seeing a member of staff to help with this was approaching 30 minutes.

Cream pasta was very cold and hard to eat. Cream was already dry when it came out. Pizza was cold as well. Just want to recommend not to go.

We used to rave about Middletons and would take every opportunity to pop in for a steak, we went there this evening for dinner with our two children and left without finishing any meal! Firstly we ordered fish goujons for our 2 year old and she was served a battered fillet of fish that was laced with bones, obviously not acceptable, especially for a child!! My main was “sticky bbq ribs” what I received was dry, unflavoured ribs with a small patch of bbq sauce that tasted horrible, the chips also had a nasty taste, my fiancé had a 10oz sirloin that was so chewy he couldn’t eat it (he has never not finished a steak!!!) they replaced my daughters fish with the chicken wrap option which I returned before she even started it as the “salad” was sloppy and had clearly been sat under a hot lamp for far to long, even though we had only just ordered it!! After complaining the waitress explained that there was an offer that “kids eat free” so she didn’t need to take them off of the bill, we paid full price for our meal and received no apology or offer of any sort of refund!!

Absolutely tastless, unchewable bacon and apart from lots of cream i didn't find any taste of garlic, or parmesan or simply salt and fresh pepper. Burrata was served with something like salad with raisins.. Very weird taste.We very very hungry and we finished our meal, but we left disappointed as the dinner spoiled our evening. The only positive site was service and staff. Then we received a check saying we need to pay £60!!!! This was our first and last time in the Spaghetti House as a chain. Never again!"

It is a bit expensive but the dishes are quite strong and fill a lot.(Original)Muy rica la ensalada César y los espaguetis a la carbonara.

google_mybusiness,eng,1,food;experience;reputation;value,Menu should have more English to help so that non Italian people can understand better but the quality of any meal are still excellent which you can relate to the price being high. I would say  that it's kind of family-friendly but overall outstanding.

facebook,eng,1,experience;food;reputation,"fab menu, great staff. The food was lovely, my husband and I had the beef roast, just a bit sad that there was not turkey or chicken on the menu.Very clean, lovely decor.Would revisit and recommend"
google_mybusiness,eng,-1,food,"Great steak but poorly complimented by the  standard frozen chips, Kentucky does better chips just to put it in perspective"
google_mybusiness,eng,-1,service,So I've visited this place twice now the first time was valentine's and the service was quite slow then but given how busy it was we thought we would give it another chance. It was the same story when we visited again though on a Monday evening. The service was slow though there was only one waitress and a manager on the floor as they had been hit by a lot of tables at the same time. This would have been ok but the first load of chips that we got came out looking and tasting like they had been refried and the blue cheese sauce had split. They were immediately replaced which was appreciated and the steak was well cooked if a bit charcoaly for my boyfriend's taste. As a good gesture they comped one of my drinks. The servers themselves were lovely just a shame about the wait and then the mistakes made with our food.
google_mybusiness,eng,-1,experience;service;food,"We had a mixed experience during our time at Middletons so I'll start with the good bits. The waiting staff and manager were great (although service was a bit slow, they were short staffed so I'll let them off) and the cocktails were delicious. We ordered the ham and leak croquettes to start which were also a delight. Unfortunately we did have a few issues with our mains. The steak was perfectly cooked to my preference (rare) however the chips for both mine and my partner's meal seemed as if they had been recooked and the sauce for my steak (blue cheese sauce) had split. The manager kindly fixed this, getting us fresh chips and a new sauce, which is why I've given it three stars rather than less. He was also kind enough to knock a little off the bill for the inconvenience, which was appreciated. I'm hoping today was just an off day for them as the staff seemed pleasant, however this experience wasn't the best, but by far it definitely wasn't the worst."

Un poulet bon je dois le reconnaitre mais la peau laquée et le jus plus que réduit au gout de brûlé m'ont stoppé dans mon élan.

Leuke inrichting en huisstijl (die menukaart!), aardig personeel wat zich niet opdringt maar er wel is als je ze nodig hebt. De vegan balletjes zijn top, en het is leuk dat je zowel voorbedachte gerechten kunt kiezen als zelf samen kunt stellen. Ook iets toevoegen aan een bestaand gerecht kan, heel fijn!

facebook,eng,1,experience;service,the staff was very polite and tentative.  the food was hot and delious . and was not overly priced. And it was my son's birthday and they even plated  his desert with happy birthday with a candle and the staff sang happy birthday . he won't admit it but it made his day and mine...we will be back!
google_mybusiness,eng,1,service;food;experience,"Enjoyed the visit although a slight delay in service but they were busy and only had 3 staff on. In fact the delay actually allowed us to enjoy each course without rushing. When served the staff were friendly and helpful. We ordered a mushroom starter, calamari and cheese starter, Calamari over cooked but everything else perfect. Mains, fillet, ribeye and ribs all amazing surprised at the standard for such a small restaurant, sides needed work but were satisfactory, desert wise went for the knickerbocker glory (mother liked it (not enough fruits) I had an espresso martini was lovely and my father had a latte which he enjoyed.  Would recommend for steak and ribs! But would recommend they got more staff to deal with a busy Sunday evening. Or at least one bar staff to deal with the drinks orders."

google_mybusiness,eng,-1,experience;service;food,"Little disappointing visit, me and my partner came for lunch, first impressions where strange, because there where no staff around who could help us to choose seats, or tell us where could we sit as there where 2 dining floors , so we went upstairs to try and get a seat up there and immediately someone said that it's closed dining area and we have to sit downstairs,  so we did came back, and there still was no one who could seat us, so few minutes later finally some lady have greeted us and offered us a seat, we ordered drinks immediately and they arrived very quick, we ordered steak fillet and one surf and turf both (well done) our waitress informed that steaks would take up to 30minutes which was fine with us, while waiting we ordered second round of drinks, and time was ticking as it passed over a 40min , then to 50min, and we still waited for food, my partner noticed that something was wrong as waitress where discussing our table with the shef  and it looked like he didn't get our table ticket, waitress approached us with saying that our steaks will take another 5-10min because they're not quite ready yet, time passed and our food finally arrived, and there came another disappointment,  size of the steaks where so small that it was so hard to believe that it took 1hour them to be cooked , obviously there was something going on, waitress mistake or sheff mistake, overall food was very tasty no doubt, but we left quite hungry, to be fair at least we expected an apology and a little discount on top of the fact that we waited so long, because our bill was 80£, of which food was 60£, waitress where lovely and we liked her hospitality, and it kinda saved our moods, we even left a tip as we always do, because we both work as waiters, but the only thing what was lacking , was to make up for that wait. We spent 2hours in there with just having a main meal, also to let you understand our position was that the place wasnt even busy, there where only another 2 tables sat besides us, so yeah that's about it. That was our visit, we could have complained, but we didn't because we didn't want to sound like a terrible customer instead we thought that waitress would make sure that their mistake would have been resolved in our favour which we would have appreciated."

I started with a very tasty plate of shell on prawns in white wine and chilli, amazing! The steak? What can I say, I had the 10oz Rump and it was cooked to perfection. The steak just melted in my mouth and the quality and presentation was commendable. My Wife has the Pate which she thoroughly enjoyed, and an 8oz Sirloin. In her own words it was the nicest steak she had ever eaten. All-in-all a great evening out and we will definitely be coming back as often as possible.

google_mybusiness,nld,-1,service;food;experience,"We hebben hier met 7 man gegeten gisteren. Bediening was niet vriendelijk of behulpzaam en er werden veel fouten gemaakt. Allereerst werd ons op de niet meest vriendelijke manier verteld dat de items die we wilden bestellen niet meer besteld konden worden. Drankjes werden regelmatig vergeten of verkeerd gebracht. De cola smaakte meer naar water: zelfs degene die in een flesje werden gebracht smaakte naar cola die flink was aangemengd met water. Daarna werden ook nog eens 2 verkeerde voorgerechten gebracht die we maar hebben geaccepteerd omdat we niet weer wilden wachten. De coleslaw die we kregen smaakte naar een riool terwijl 1 portie coleslaw met een hele andere kleur wel goed smaakte. Toen ik hier iets van zei werd er nog net geen discussie gestart voordat er nieuwe werden gebracht. Toen we 2 porties friet tekort kwamen vroeg ik erom en ze kwamen terug met 1 portie. Het vlees smaakte over het algemeen verder wel prima (entrecote en spareribs) Maar de combinatie van een slechte service en matig eten maakt het dat wij hier niet terug zullen komen.(Translated by Google)We ate here with 7 people yesterday. Service was not friendly or helpful and many mistakes were made. First of all we were told in the most unkind way that the items we wanted to order could no longer be ordered. Drinks were regularly forgotten or brought wrong. The cola tasted more like water: even those who were put in a bottle tasted like cola that had been thoroughly mixed with water. After that also 2 wrong starters were brought which we accepted because we did not want to wait again. The coleslaw that we got tasted like a sewer while 1 portion of coleslaw with a completely different color tasted good. When I said something about this, there was just no discussion started before new ones were brought. When we lacked 2 portions of fries, I asked and they came back with 1 portion. The meat generally tasted fine (prime rib and spare ribs) But the combination of poor service and moderate food means that we will not come back here."

De Sirloin en Spareribs waren heerlijk.De keuze van mijn vrouw wat minder. Er werd matig advies gegeven over de burgers die besteld konden worden. Ze is zwanger, dus kan niet alles eten. Het enige advies was dat de Cheeseburger lekker is. Terwijl ze naar mogelijkheden met kip vroeg.De bestelde pasta was prima, maar geen smaak sensatie.Het verschil in bediening was groot. Een jongen kwam te hulp schieten. Die was scherp, gaf aandacht, oprecht en opmerkzaam. Hij merkte ook op dat de pasta van mij vrouw niet op tafel stond terwijl de rest al even het eten had.Degene die ons moeilijk advies kon geven hadden wij al gevraagd of de pasta goed was doorgekomen. Ze zei ik kom zo, maar ze kwam niet en leek niet te begrijpen wat te doen. De jongen liep naar de balie en haalt de pasta daar op. Die stond al koud te worden daar. Daar had gelijk werk van gemaakt moeten worden. We hebben prima eten gehad. Er was gelukkig een scherp personeelslid die het goed deed verlopen. De andere was een stuk minder.

Verder namen we een voorgerecht & hoofdgerecht. Echter door een “technische” fout werden al onze gerechten samen op tafel gedropt en werden we aan ons lot overgelaten. Na enkele minuten werd het personeel zich bewust van deze fout waarna ze onze hoofdgerechten terugnamen en deze onder de warmtelamp in de keuken gingen plaatsen. Toen we onze voorgerechten hadden opgegeten zijn we na 10 minuten zelf naar de toog moeten stappen met de vraag of we onze hoofdgerechten al dan niet konden terugkrijgen. Het was helemaal niet druk maar kennelijk had het personeel iets van groter belang te doen aan de bar waardoor klanten in de zaal verwaarloosd achterbleven. De hoofdgerechten werden terug aan tafel gebracht, deze waren nog ok van temperatuur maar uiteraard hadden we liever een verse maaltijd gehad, de technische fout was dan ook niet door ons veroorzaakt en wij zouden hier dan ook zeker niet de dupe van mogen zijn. Na het hoofdgerecht werd er nog gevraagd of we eventueel een nagerecht wouden wat oorspronkelijk wel het plan was maar door de vele tegenslagen wouden we dit risico niet meer nemen, hebben onze rekening betaalt en zijn doorgegaan met gemengde gevoelens & of dit de trip vanuit antwerpen wel waard was.

It is now joined in the upscale segment by Manhattn's and Ellis (from Brussels) as well as Jack's (from Ghent) and arguably Five Guys (from the USA) slightly lower down the ladder. The unique selling proposition of De Burgerij (aside from being the first one) is the meat. They pride themselves on having the best meat and (while this is largely subjective), I concur. The meat (or chicken patties) tend to be juicy and soft, without being a soggy mess.De Burgerij will give you a good burger in a pleasant atmosphere with unique sides compared to the other 4 (onion rings!). The terrace gives a great view on the MAS and staff is [usually] helpful."

We could not hold a conversation without yelling at each other. The “entertainment “ was very bad and extremely irritating. We expected great Indonesian food, but were disappointed by many dishes, which were tasteless. The nasi goreng was very oily and gave those who ate it upset stomachs. We are all Indos and know our Indonesian food. All in all an overpriced disappointing experience for myself and 12 of my relatives.."

On the plus side, the garden seating is lovely."

google_mybusiness,eng,1,service;food,"Benefit of the doubt as my experience was not that good. Went to eat here upon advice of a colleague. My order was taken quickly. After 15 minutes the same waiter comes back to take my order. After I told here that I already ordered with her she asked to give my order again as something apparently went wrong. After another 15 minute without food or drink (other tables did get their drinks, not food) and no waiter in sight I went in and asked at the bar. No order could be found in their system and I was asked to give my order for a third time. At that time the waiter resurfaces with my order. According to the staff their system messes up quite often and orders go missing. The drink was on the house (good move!) And the veggie burger was tasty. Whenever I have the opportunity I will try again."

formitable,nld,-1,service;food,"we werden warm ontvangen. we bestelden drank & hoofdgerechten voor 5 (3 volwassenen en 2 kinderen). 1 van onze kinderen is glutenintolerant, we zochten samen naar een passend gerecht (met hulp van de ober en chef, waarvoor dank). so far, so good. de porties zelf waren redelijk klein. en dan ging het mis. we voelden ons verplicht om nog dessert en/of koffie te nemen, dat hoefde niet voor ons. onze kinderen kregen een ijsje dat was inbegrepen in hun kinderschotel, maar de ober wou hem een glutenvrije appelcrumble 'aanbieden'. toen duidelijk werd dat we die gewoon zouden moeten betalen, en het gratis ijsje zo zou vervallen, hebben we ook dat vriendelijk geweigerd. de ober liet ons ondertussen ook duidelijk blijken dat we precies niet aan zijn verwachtingen voldeden. we hebben de rekening betaald en zijn vertrokken, de ober keek ostentatief weg toen we hem passeerden, geen goeienavond of niks. er zullen ongetwijfeld 'betere' klanten zijn, die voorgerecht, hoofdgerecht en dessert nemen, en daar lekker veel bij drinken. maar om ons daarom het gevoel te geven dat we eigenlijk niet welkom zijn en dat heel dat warm onthaal maar een fake toneeltje was, dat vonden we niet zo fijn. dus neen, absoluut geen aanrader, en voor ons ook geen gempemolen meer."

formitable,nld,-1,service,"Beste Lezer,Helaas moet ik u vertellen dat het een teleurstellende avond was qua service en rumoerigheid. De plaatselijke kroeg aan de overkant is nog rustiger van binnen dan het restaurant. Bij  aankomst werden wij ontvangen door de gastvrouw van uw restaurant. Deze gaf totaal geen gehoor aan onze opmerking, dat wij een jarige in ons midden hadden. Waarna ze enorm arrogant gedrag vertoonde. Om even kort door de bocht de gastvrouw te omschrijven is het een ordinaire vrouw die totaal de vraag van de klant mijt. Geen aanwinst voor het restaurant. Verder was de service aan de slechte kant. Na de tweede gang hebben wij een uur moeten wachten op de derde gang. Er is ons niet gevraagd of het tempo qua gerechten omhoog moest. Dit hoort wel. Het eten was uitmuntend.

Het piepkuiken vond ik vlak in smaak, het toastje erbij met de kippenlever en peer geweldig. De dragonmayo is heerlijk maar paste totaal niet bij de gerechten dat  we hadden besteld daarom gewone mayo gevraagd. Ik vond alleen dat de porties wat te klein waren, je moet er echt een bijgerecht bij bestellen anders is het zeker te weinig anders was het een 9/10 geweest. Kleine opmerking wat betreft de toiletten: de trap er naar toe was niet schoon en op de speakers zeer storende voetbalcommentaar (bij de mannen) en iets vaags raar gesprek (bij de vrouwen).

formitable,nld,1,reputation;service;food,"Gerechten waren wederom heerlijk. Vriendelijk en kundig personeel. Porties wel aan de kleine klant. 2 en 4 jaar geleden ook bij jullie geluncht. Smaak fantastisch, maar porties mag 1,5 groter"
formitable,eng,-1,service;food,"Overall a good experience, the food was delicious, but the service was terrible and really not at the level of a 1star restaurant: wrong bottle of champagne served, obviously more expensive and without apologies, obliged to refill the glasses by ourselves), very long waiting time without receiving an amuse. In addition, not normal to be invoiced a French fries supplement when you already pay your steak 100€. For the rest the meat was excellent, the cooking perfect, the bearnaise as well."
formitable,eng,1,experience;food,All the dishes we ordered were remarkable but the portions were a little bit too small. Anyway we really loved our dinner! Good value for money.
formitable,nld,1,service;food;experience,Het eten was erg lekker en het personeel was heel vriendelijk. We komen graag nog eens terug! De wijn bij het eten was ook ontzettend lekker (Monastrell).
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,heerlijk eten maar vooral ook leuke bediening
formitable,nld,0,food;service,"Gezellig geluncht , was lekker, tussen de gerechten duurde echt te lang"
formitable,nld,1,experience;food;service,Weer enorm genoten. Wat een fijne gerechten en top wijn.  Bediening natuurlijk ook super!
formitable,nld,-1,food;service,"Helaas was ons bezoek dit keer niet zo goed als we gewend waren. Bediening was niet heel scherp, en mijn vriend voelde zich later niet zo lekker van of de langoustine of de kreeft. Jammer!"
formitable,nld,-1,reputation;food;service,"Inmiddels ben ik een aantal keer bij jullie in het restaurant wezen eten. Helaas viel het deze keer qua bediening erg tegen; halfvolle bakjes patat werden zonder te vragen na de eerste gang mee genomen, borden met eten werden op tafel gezet zonder te checken wie wat besteld had waardoor we deze zelf op de tafel moesten (her)verdelen, we moesten constant bediening wenken voor nieuw drinken, wijn werd uitgeserveerd zonder toelichting op de smaken e.d.. Qua service veel minder prettig dan dat ik voorheen gewend was en verwacht bij een 'luxere' lunch aangelegenheid."
formitable,eng,1,experience,We missed the ice cream but everything was still outstanding
formitable,und,1,experience,X
formitable,nld,1,service;experience;value,"Wij zijn zeer regelmatige gasten. Elke keer weer gaan we met een voldaan en plezierig gevoel naar huis. Het eten is uitstekend, de bediening zeer professioneel en vriendelijk en de sfeer is uitstekend. Voor een ieder is dit een absolute aanrader!"
formitable,nld,1,experience;environment,Nog steeds een ontzettend fijne plek voor een uitgebreide zondagslunch - bijvoorbeeld met vrienden. Gerechtjes zijn met zorg samengesteld en uitgevoerd. Originele wijnen voor een goede prijs. Bediening vriendelijk en adequaat. Misschien ietwat hard geruis op de achtergrond.
formitable,nld,1,experience;service,Lunchen bij Ron Blaauw Gastrobar is altijd een beleving. Je voelt je echt in de watten gelegd. De gerechtjes zijn super en de bediening erg vriendelijk. Heerlijk ontspannen lunchen. Enig minpuntje: doordat op het kleine terras voor de zaak gerookt wordt ruikt de gehele garderobe naar de rook. Dit vond ik niet prettig. Heb je heerlijk gegeten en dan bij het wachten op je jas sta je noodgedwongen in de vieze sigarettenrook geur.
formitable,eng,1,experience;food,"Everything was amazing, highlights were the mackerel, the short ribs and the bucket of ice cream. Yum!"
formitable,eng,1,experience,We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Ron Gastrobar. The food was fantastic and unique and the service was top-notch. Well done across the board and we look forward to returning next time we come to Amsterdam!
google_mybusiness,nld,-1,food;environment,"Gezellig druk, stadse sfeer, veel lawaai. Er wordt aanbevolen te kiezen uit een lijst gerechtjes van € 17,50, de meeste trouwens met een (flinke) toeslag. Twee of drie gerechten zouden voldoende zijn voor een hoofdgerecht. Op de rechterbladzijde een lijstje gerechten die je met zijn tweeën moet bestellen. Prijzen rond € 47,50. Maar aan een zo'n gerecht heb je te weinig, aanbevolen wordt om er dan nog een klein gerecht bij te nemen. Ik nam uit het linkerrijtje een bereiding met rauwe makreel. Een soort koekje. Nogal klein maar wel smakelijk. Mijn tafelgenoot nam piepkuiken en kreeg een heel kleine kippenpoot met een plakje  kippenlever. Samen deelden we een zeebaars. Uitstekend gebakken. Erbij een schaaltje friet. Groente moest apart worden besteld, we namen samen een salade á € 8,50. Glas wijn € 7,50. Bier € 4,75. Fles plat water (kraanwater was beter geweest) € 6. We zagen af van een dessert en namen thee. We hoefde slechts één thee te betalen á € 4,50. In totaal € 126 en onbevredigend gevoel. In de toiletten werd ik onthaald met knetterharde fragmenten sportverslaggeving. Meest voetbal. Het was niet te harden zo hard als het stond. Waarom in vredesnaam? Wat voegt dat toe? We kregen geen amuse, wel een mandje gewoon brood en een bakje smeersel. Het eten is goed bereid, verse producten maar is beslist niet creatief of culinair. Niveau Parijse bistro, maar minder keus. Prijs-kwaliteitverhouding volkomen scheef. Hier ga ik niet meer naar toe.(Translated by Google)Nice and busy, urban atmosphere, lots of noise. It is recommended to choose from a list of dishes of € 17.50, most of them with a (substantial) surcharge. Two or three dishes would suffice for a main course. On the right-hand side a list of dishes that you have to order as a couple. Prices around € 47.50. But you do not have enough on such a dish, it is recommended to take a small dish with it. I took out the top half of a formulation containing raw mackerel. A kind of cookie. Rather small but tasty. My table companion took spring chicken and got a very small chicken leg with a slice of chicken liver. Together we shared a sea bass. Excellent baked. Add a dish of fries. Vegetables had to be ordered separately, together we took a salad for € 8.50. Glass of wine € 7.50. Beer € 4.75. Bottle of flat water (tap water would have been better) € 6. We decided against dessert and had tea. We have to pay only one tea at € 4.50. In total € 126 and feeling unsatisfactory. In the toilets I was greeted with rock-hard fragments of sports coverage. Most football. It was hard to harden as it stood. Why the hell? What does that add? We didn't get an appetizer, but a basket of plain bread and a bowl of spread. The food is well prepared, fresh produce but is certainly not creative or culinary. Level Parisian bistro, but less choice. Price-quality ratio totally skewed. I'm not going here anymore."
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,"Diner ziet er uit als kleine kunstwerkjes. Alle zintuigen komen aan bod; smaak, geur en zicht. Personeel is ook vriendelijk voor je hond en komt zelfs met bak water. A-plus!"
formitable,nld,1,service;food,"Top service, lekker gegeten weer"
formitable,nld,1,service;food;experience,"Personeel had goede balans tussen beleefd/formeel en gastvrij ontspannen. Was niet gehaast of gestressed erg fijn.Tweede keer, eten was kwalitatief erg goed. Tartaar was wat aan de kleine kant en ben zelf gecharmeerd van de traditionele presentatie, maar kwaliteit was erg goed."
formitable,nld,1,experience,"Het enige wat ik niet zo prettig vond was dat ik na een reservering, bevestiging én reminder 2 dagen van tevoren op de dag zelf 's middags gebeld werd tijdens mijn werk of ik nog van plan was om te komen......Ik begrijp echter ook dat veel mensen niet komen opdagen, maar dit soort telefoontjes tijdens mijn werk zijn wel storend. Ik zou willen voorstellen dat men dan een bericht gestuurd wordt op de dag zelf waarin men in een replay alsnog kan afzeggen.........Vervelend als dat gebeurd op het laatste moment, maar dan weten jullie het tenminste toch.vriendelijke groet, Ludwine Lambalk"
formitable,nld,1,food;service,Zeer lekker gegeten en de bediening was uitmate vriendelijk
formitable,nld,1,food;service,verrassende combinaties en zeer vriendelijke bediening
formitable,eng,-1,food;service;environment,"We travel often via Amsterdam, and 3 years ago we had our first dinner at Ron. We had such a great experience and amazing food that we decided to book our dinner again in our only night in the city this year. We were placed in a similar table and the server (blond young lady) got to explain the concept of the kitchen as we order our food. As some dishes arrived, the server who brought them tried to clear our table to fit all, as we have wine and water bottles, 4 glasses and our plates, (placing the bag of bread on top of my husband’s plate). We tried to manage but we could barely move a glass. When she stopped by to check if everything was fine, we started asking her if she could ask the kitchen to hold some of dishes as we don’t have enough space, she turns and says “I thought you understood the concept of the restaurant”, and as we tried to continue explaining the lack of space she cut us short with “ok, then, what can I do for you”? With such an attitude and aggressiveness that we were taken aback, and even embarrassed when we noticed customers from a table near us looking at the situation. What was supposed to be a wonderful night became sour immediately, I lost my appetite and we were in silence for awhile, really disappointed for the memories we were taking from this night. Along with the food, the experience is part of what makes a restaurant stay with us whenever we go. Unfortunately, Ron Gastrobar will no longer be part of our favorite places."
formitable,nld,1,food;experience,"Wij hebben met elkaar enorm genoten van de gerechten. Veel keuze en alles even lekker. Fijne dienstverlening & gastvrijheid. Aandachtpuntje is de open deur naar het terras die bij het afkoelen in de avond zorgt voor een bries over de schouders wat een onaangenaam gevoel geeft. Medewerkers hebben het, op verzoek, later op de avond opgelost door de deur te sluiten. Dank voor een heerlijke avond."
formitable,nld,1,food;experience,"Het gezelschap, mijn vrouw en haar nichtje, was bijzonder prettig en aangenaam.Voeg daar bij de zeer vriendelijke en vakbekwame bediening en uiteraard de kwaliteit van de lunch en het hele plaatje zit erg goed in elkaar."
formitable,nld,-1,food;service;value,Ik had kreeft besteld wat €17.50 extra betekende In totaal dus 35€ voor een stukje kreeft van de staart ongeveer 10 cm in lengte daarbij wat slierten van een meiknolletje en wat saus Lekker maar naar mijn smaak erg duurDe bediening vond ik niet attent laat staan vriendelijk Wij kregen 3 koffies op tafel gesmeten zonder lepeltjes of suiker.Er zou wat gedaan kunnen worden aan de akoestiek wij konden elkaar nauwelijks verstaan
formitable,nld,1,food;service;experience,"Altijd gezellig en topkwaliteit. Hele attente bediening, een feest daar te lunchen of dineren."
formitable,nld,-1,service,Bediening vond ik minder.
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;reputation,"Groupon deal of niet, de gerechten die je kunt bestellen zijn van een hoog niveau. Voor de derde keer hier gegeten en het blijft een heerlijk verwen moment voor jezelf. Absolute aanrader! Je proeft de aandacht die aan alles wordt besteed."
formitable,eng,1,service;environment,"Great food, friendly waitresses and very nice ambiance on a beautiful terrace. Felt like holiday, especially since they served our favourite spanish rose, Muga!"
formitable,nld,1,experience,"de zon scheen en zonder probleem werd het zonnescherm naar beneden gedaan, zo prettig om in de schaduw te genieten van de smaakvolle lunch"
formitable,nld,1,service;experience;food,Zeer nette en correcte service. En wederom top gegeten. Tot de volgende keer
formitable,nld,1,experience;service,"Mooie locatie, alles is goed verzorgd, het personeel is erg vriendelijk. Prettige sfeer en omgeving. Het eten is heerlijk."
formitable,nld,-1,environment,Waren vroeg.Kregen achteraf tafeltje terwijl overige betere tafels hele avond leeg bleven.Gevraagd waarom wij geen betere tafel hadden gekregen(kwamen vaker nog daar)maar dat had ik dan zelf moeten aangeven.M.i. geen goed beleid.
formitable,nld,1,service,Zeer gastvrij personeel en prachtig terras.Als altijd zeer goede kwaliteit en heerlijke ambiance.
formitable,eng,1,food,Very informal and delicious
formitable,nld,1,food;experience,Kan niets anders zeggen dan dat mijn moeder en ik heerlijk gegeten hebben. Dat ging vergezeld van smakelijke wijn en een prettige gastvrije bediening. Alle medewerkers hadden ook voor ons. Bijvoorbeeld bij het voorbij lopen een begroeting die oprecht overkwam. Verrast werden we nog door het heerlijke  mini ijsje.
formitable,deu,1,experience;environment,Fantastische avond gehad!
google_mybusiness,por,-1,environment,"Muita variedade de bolos e salgados. Apenas o barulho ensurdecedor das louças a serem manuseadas é que torna o ambiente menos agradável, há alturas que nem se consegue conversar."
google_mybusiness,por,1,experience;food;service,Jantar maravilhoso. Equipe muito atenciosa e pratos excelentes.
formitable,nld,1,service;food;experience;environment,"In een woord, heerlijk !Eten uiteraard fantastisch, vlotte professionele bediening, lekker op t terras gegeten. Tot de voldoende keer."
formitable,nld,1,experience;environment;food,"We hebben heerlijk gegeten. De ambiance is erg goed, vriendelijk personeel. Een goede plek om een hele gezellige avond te hebben."
formitable,nld,1,reputation;experience;service;food,Blijf in herhaling vallen. Kom er daarom met enige regelmaat. Kaart verandert zeer regelmatig dus iedere keer weer verrassing. Aanrader!
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;environment,"Gisteren ‘s middags geweest. Ontvangen en naar tafel. Met mooi weer is er voor iedereen buiten plek. Het terras is gezellig gemaakt en muziek goed. Het lijkt wel eenBeach club. Bediening perfect. Formule eten is ontzettend leuk voor 29,50 twee gerechten plus dessert (als je vooraf reserveert en betaalt). Niet zoals je van ster klassieke stijl verwacht. Meer een super BiB. De gerechten zijn delicaat en zeer smaakvol lijken klein maar het hele menu is prima. Leuke wijnkaart met veel wijnen per glas. Vind ik leuk drink graag verschillend bubbels, sauvignon, moscatel, Rioja crianza en rode dessert moscatel. Kom zeker terug. En 7 dagen open!"
formitable,nld,1,experience;service,Eten was zeer lekker. Goede combinaties van smaken. De dragon mayo is heerlijk! Bediening was zeer goed en netjes.
formitable,nld,1,reputation;food;experience,Het was weer een toplunch bij Ron. De hapjes van de nieuwe kaart waren een succes. Erg fijne middag gehad!
formitable,eng,1,service;food,"I usually go for the 6 course menu. This time, however, I was not super happy about it:The two first dishes were extremely salty and spicy (especially the second one), which is not something I expected. Not everybody likes chili in their food, and I certainly do not. The other dishes were good, including the traditional ribs.Service was very kind, but one of the waiters seemed to be in a super hurry to introduce the dishes."
formitable,nld,1,service,"Prima, service. Zaten aan de bar, goede ervaren service gerichte barman"
formitable,eng,1,experience;service;food,"The dim sum was incredible. The Rose was lovely and the Singapore noodles were very tasty. Staff were really nice. However, the music was too loud as the speaker was above us. So it was hard having a conversation. Also we felt a little rushed being on the early fork benefit."
formitable,nld,1,experience;service,Perfecte avond. Goede mix tussen aandacht van personeel en privacy.
formitable,nld,-1,reputation;service;environment,"In sommige gerechten te veel sojasaus gebruikt en het smaakte daarom veel te zoutig. Daarbij veel te luide muziek. Op het einde van de avond hadden wij schorre kelen van het harde praten. De ober raffelde de toelichting op de gerechten af. Overigens had hij net zo goed niks hoeven uit te leggen want door de harde muziek verstonden we hem toch niet. Alles bij elkaar: niet wat ik gewend ben van dineren bij Ron Blaauw. Nee, voor ons niet voor herhaling vatbaar bij Ron Blaauw Oriental in de Kerkstraat!"
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;environment,"Het eten was erg goed, de bediening zeer vriendelijk en professioneel met goede aanbevelingen. 1 klein minpuntje de muziek stond vrij hard, hier wat over gezegd en toen ging die wel zachter maar eigenlijk zou geen muziek veel prettiger zijn."
google_mybusiness,eng,1,food;experience,"very teasty food and very frindly team. prices are fair. the menu is hard to understand, but you can get hep from the ladies working there. this place acn br fitting for a date and birthday, dont miss the duck! super tasty!"
formitable,eng,1,experience;service,"Everything was perfect, service is really good, they explain all the dishes, help with choices and serve the dishes the best way possible. Food is amazing."
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,"Heerlijk gegeten , professionele  bediening"
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,"Voor de verjaardag van vriendin bij jullie gegeten. Goede service en heerlijk gegeten, aan de prijs maar kreeg je veel voor terug!"
formitable,nld,1,reputation;service;food,Fantastisch gegeten. Goede bediening. Tip: let op verwelkte bloemen op de bar
formitable,nld,1,service;food,tevreden. werd lief en deskundig bediend en heb heerlijk gegeten. Dank jullie wel
formitable,nld,1,experience;service,Bij binnenkomst heel plezierig ontvangen en op een nette manier naar de tafel begeleidHeerlijke Dim Sum en daarna drie prachtige gerechtjes met veel smaak Dat alle gecomplementeerd met een heerlijke wijnEn dat voor een zeer acceptabel prijsniveau - normaal betaal je veel meer voor dit niveau in restaurantsIk kom weer terug!
formitable,nld,1,reputation;service;food,Heerlijk eten en vriendelijk en meedenkend personeel!
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,"Fantastisch eten en ontspannen, vriendelijke bediening"
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,"Buitengemeen hartelijke ontvangst en bediening, ook al was het loeidruk en liepen ze zich het vuur uit hun schoenen. Goede prijs-qualiteit en fraaie omgeving. Een aanrader!"
google_mybusiness,eng,1,food;service;experience,"(Translated by Google) Very well eaten, top service. In a word, first class(Original)Sehr gut gegessen, top Service. Mit einem Wort    Erstklass"
formitable,nld,1,service;food,Heerlijk gegeten. Service was uitstekend!
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,"Wij waren voor het eerst dat wij bij Ron’s Gastrobar Amsterdam. Je wordt er heel vriendelijk ontvangen en jassen worden aangenomen bij de garderobe. We hebben heerlijk gegeten met 5 personen. Zo hebben we gevarieerd aantal gerechten kunnen proeven, (van de kaart totaal 15 gerechten voor het voor- en hoofdgerecht). Zonder uitzondering waren ze allemaal uitzonderlijk goed. Fijne smaak en elk gerecht verrassend lekker.Fijne zeer vriendelijke bediening in een mooi restaurant maakt helemaal Top. Dank voor de fijne avond.Helaas geen ‘10’ maar een ‘9’ omdat wij de prijzen van drankjes aan de hoge kant vinden."
formitable,nld,-1,reputation;food,"Beetje teleurgesteld waren we wel.Dim Sum was erg goed, de loempia was een ondefinieerbaar vet gerecht zonder veel smaak, de spare-ribs wel lekker maar niet bijzonder, de octopus was goed en de lamshart speciaal. Het toetje van banaanmeringue was weer erg lekker"
formitable,nld,0,service;food,"We hebben een superleuk avond gehad in een mooie atmosfeer met hele leuke bediening. Echter vond ik het uitserveren vanuit de keuken heel rommelig. Er waren 3 porties Dim sum over 2 bordjes verdeeld, toen we dachten dat we alle dim sum hadden gekregen kwamen er nog 2 porties. Dat gedeelte verliep rommelig.Toen kregen we de hele eend, we dachten eigenlijk dat die als hele eend op tafel zou komen. Helaas dus niet. De pulpo als hoofdgerecht was smakeloos. Softshellcrab en de spare ribs waren heel kleine porties. Buikspek was wel goed.Als slot stuk wilden we de icebuckets, echter was er nog maar 1.Overigens was de zeebaars en de rivierkreeft ook al van het menu door schaarste.Nogmaals aan de bediening lag het niet. Topsfeertje.Echter ik zou hier niet meer terugkomen."
formitable,eng,1,experience;food;service,"We had an early 3 course dinner yesterday and although Ron gastrobar only opens at 17:30 for dinner, we were welcomed at 17:10 already. Food was as always amazing and service great! Really recommend the wagyu dim sum and the Peking duck. Delicious!Ron was and will continue to be one of my preferred restaurants in Amsterdam. Worth a visit!"
formitable,nld,1,service;environment,eten was echt super lekker en de bediening perfect
formitable,nld,0,food;environment,We eten hier heel vaak. Heerlijk eten. Aardige bediening. Maar iedere keer dacht ik “kan de muziek iets zachter”. Want de akoestiek is al heel slecht. Aantal mensen in mijn omgeving willen niet komen eten vanwege de muziek.
formitable,nld,0,food;service;environment,"De avond begon goed, mede dankzij de prettige gastheer. Hij gaf goed advies, dacht leuk mee en eerlijk is eerlijk verleende in het begin goede service. Helaas kakte dit halverwege de avond in. Bediending liet op zich wachten. Ook hadden wij aan het begin van de avond aangegeven dat 2 van de 3 gasten geen koriander aten. Toch zat dit op meerdere gerechtjes. Erg jammer! De kwaliteit van het eten was ook wisselend. Zaten een paar top gerechtjes tussen (wagu dim sum, sliptong). Echter de bao met rundvlees en foi gras was flauw en de noedels ook.Om toch positief te eindigen, Oriental is een mooie zaak met een fijne ambiance."
formitable,nld,1,reputation;food;experience,"Elke hap was een smaakexplosie. Het maakt niet uit welk gerecht je neemt, het is allemaal heerlijk."
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,Hele mooie ervaring. Uit te lichten is de attente en goede service. Vriendelijk ontvangst en explicaties. Wij zaten aan het einde van de bar en konden zo de achterkant van de bar in kijken..verbeteringspunt: zet er een klein deurtje voor. ziet er niet al te schoon uit en zeer rommelig als het druk is.Mooie wijnen. Spatburgunder gedronken. verbeteringspunt: champagne. Bij een zo mooi oriantaalse keuken zou ik mij een fles Veuve Clicquot goed kunnen voorstellen met een vollere karakter vanwege de pinot noir gehalte. dank voor d eleuke avond.
formitable,nld,1,experience,Prachtige avond gehad. Heerlijk eten. Echt niets op aan te merken.
formitable,nld,1,experience;service,Heerlijke gerechten mooie atmosfeer
formitable,nld,1,service;food,ETEN WAS ERG LEKKER EN VERS
google_mybusiness,dan,1,experience,Geweldig!!(Translated by Google)Awesome!!
google_mybusiness,eng,1,experience,Good restaurant which combines Asian kitchen with different influences. Compared to the other Gastrobars I have to say that I liked this place but for example prefer the normal gastrobar above this one. This has nothing to do with the quality of the food or service but is purely a personal taste.
formitable,nld,1,experience,Heerlijk gegeten en onze favoriet Tilly is back en heeft haar eigen Ron 👍🏻 Heerlijke rose champagne genomen en het eten was ook weer top. Jammer dat Wouter het pand gaat verlaten en wensen hem veel succes met zijn nieuwe uitdaging en Tilly met de hare.
formitable,nld,1,experience;environment;food;service,"Mooie zaak, fijne bediening, heerlijk eten"
formitable,nld,1,experience;food,"Zeer genoten van ons bezoek, vriendelijke service van begin tot einde! Eten was heerlijk. We hadden wat Dim Sum & een paar losse gerechten. Smaken waren lekker en verrassend. Kritische punten: De portie grootte van de ‘dishes’ mag wel wat meer zijn. Voor wat je krijgt is het wat overpriced + 6 euro voor een fles water ... tsja dat is niet nodig!"
formitable,nld,1,food;service;experience,"Zoals altijd was het een plezier bij jullie te eten. het eten was heerlijk en innovatief, de wijn goed uitgekozen door de ober en de service persoonlijk en vriendelijk. we komen zeker weer terug"
formitable,eng,-1,service,Hi really enjoyed your restaurant except i did not get the 20% discount for eating early that was promised on my reservation and I got food poisoning and was extremely unwell all night and still shaky. So no I won’t be recommending your restaurant :(
formitable,nld,0,experience;food;service,De ober die ons bediende was uiterst overdreven bij het irritante af. De gin tonic kaart die online staat komt niet overeen met die van het restaurant. De geranium bv was volgens de ober niet in huis. Toen we wilde bestellen bleek dat de rivierkreeft er niet was. Het had beter geweest om dit te zeggen toen wij de kaart overhandigd kregen ipv na het kiezen van de gerechten. Als afsluiter toest de ober 250 euro in op de pinautomaat terwijl ik doe maar 205 had gezegd. Het eten was wel weer geweldig zoals gewoonlijk.
formitable,nld,0,food;service,"Eten weer heerlijk. Onze ober aardig, maar vreselijk vermoeiend. Niet meer ons “gezelschap” noemen. Beetje downgraden, dit was echt overdreven."
formitable,eng,-1,food,"Food was not upto expectation. The starters can definitely be better in taste, main course was fine. Also, while we were leaving after payment the service came with ice cream near the door, ideally this should have been done when we were still at our table.. maybe a mistake but seemed like a basic service."
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;environment,"Wij hebben heerlijk gegeten in een gezellige sfeer, de bediening was zeer vriendelijk en beleefd."
formitable,eng,1,experience;food;environment;service,"Thought I was half lucky to score a last minute table for 1 at Ron's Oriental having read about the original (solo business traveler luck) and had that confirmed while there. Great food, wonderful suggestions by Max the bartender and the kitchen, and the chance to watch my dumplings made behind me were part of an amazing evening of flavors !  Danke wel !"

formitable,nld,1,service;food;value,"De bediening was uitermate vriendelijk. Heel lekker gegeten. De voorgerechtjes waren een beetje aan de dure kant, maar voor de rest was alles zeker betaalbaar."
formitable,nld,-1,experience;food,"Eigenlijk ben ik fan van jullie, maar mijn zusje kreeg coleslaw die duidelijk niet meer goed was. Ze nam een hap en ging bijna over haar nek. Haar vriendinnetje is sous-chef en die rook eraan en gaf aan dat dit duidelijk niet meer goed was, zo zuur dat het rook. Meer dan logisch dat het van de rekening af werd gehaald, maar in zo’n geval moet je eigenlijk wel even meer doen dan alleen “sorry” zeggen. Er is wel gevraagd of ze iets anders wilde, maar ze was, na deze ervaring, wel echt uitgegeten. Logisch. Een drankje van de zaak was op z’n plek geweest. Je geeft een klant een duidelijk rot product! Echt niet OK! Sowieso niet de standaard die je verwacht en al helemaal niet bij TGI."

formitable,nld,1,service;environment;food,Naast dat het eten erg lekker was hebben de bediening en de ambiance de avond geweldig gemaakt. Super enthousiast personeel!
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;environment,"Het eten was ook in het pop up-restaurant prima. En we hadden ook niet anders verwacht. De kaart was beperkter dan we gewend zijn, jammer maar ook begrijpelijk. De rijsttafel was met z’n vieren meer dan voldoende en heel gevarieerd. De verrassing zat wat mij betreft in de tofu en in de cheesecake met tapioca. Tofu vind ik maar heel zelden echt lekker en in dit geval heb ik niets laten liggen! Tapioca werd door mijn oma altijd geserveerd als iets oneetbaars.  Mijn tafelgenoten kozen voor andere desserts, maar lepelden graag uit mijn bordje mee. Heerlijk luchtig en een fijne combinatie met de fruitige cheesecake. We kijken uit naar het verbouwde restaurant en de dan weer volledige kaart"
facebook,nld,1,experience,"De afgelopen week, tussen de bedrijven/business door:Maandag 5-8 rustigjes '30 jaar met mijn lief' Irene gevierd bij Ron Gastrobars en ff bijgepraat met chef Agus Hermawan;Woensdag 7-8 was dochter Dilys Renaud jarig, die verjaardag vieren we nog, want zij was op vakantie;Ook woensdag 7-8 was er een leuk reünie-etentje met mijn buurmeisje uit Bali (periode 1954-1956) Ruth Schmit. Zij woont al sinds 1959 in de Verenigde Staten. Via een nichtje van haar (Iris Saulus) en via Fb (of was het zelfs eerst nog via Hyves) is er weer een contact ontstaan.Ruth was met haar dochter Stephanie A. Jade Cox en nog 5 andere dames in Nederland voor een bijeenkomst en deze gelegenheid heeft zij ook benut om mij weer te ontmoeten.We hebben deze reünie gevierd met een heerlijke rijsttafel bij Mooi Zeist - Indonesisch Restaurant. Daar zat ik dan te midden van 8 dames... ☺️ Donderdag 8-8 werd mijn schoonmoeder 86 jaar. We hebben haar getrakteerd op een mooi boottochtje met lunch op de Lingestreek: rivier de Linge & omgeving met Rederij LeerdamZaterdag 10-8 hebben we ook weer supergezellig doorgebracht met Hilde Heppe en Gunther Robeets in het gezellige Leuven. We hebben fijn gebabbeld, gedronken en gedineerd in De Klimop en overnacht in Novotel Leuven Centrum..."

formitable,nld,1,food;environment;experience,"Ter gelegenheid van mijn verjaardag hebben wij zaterdag j.l. een vroege fork diner met 8 personen bij jullie genoten. Alles verliep prima, een uiterst vriendelijke bediening en een heerlijke rijsttafel met vooraf een taco. Deze taco is favoriet bij ons, alleen ditmaal niet helemaal warm... maar waarschijnlijk lastig met een groep van 8.   Maar overall heerlijk gegeten, de bediening krijgt een 10 en komen graag weer terug wanneer jullie weer in de eigen locatie zitten, want die is natuurlijk nog gezelliger!"
formitable,nld,0,food,Enige verbeterpunt: al het eten incl de rijst was op zijn best lauw.

Attente bediening (om door een ringetje te halen), ondanks de verbouwing zeer goede ontvangst 'backstage'. We namen de grote rijsttafel. Werkelijk voortreffelijk gegeten.

formitable,nld,0,environment;experience,"Hoewel ik me realiseer dat jullie momenteel een tijdelijk onderkomen hebben, was mijn eerste indruk toen ik binnen kwam: 'wat een vreselijk kabaal!' Ik was er met vier vrienden en het was moeilijk om elkaar te kunnen verstaan. Na een tijdje ging er ook nog (keiharde) muziek aan, die gelukkig op verzoek wat zachter werd gedraaid.Verder zaten we naast de toegangsdeur tot het terras, wat betekende dat iedere keer dat iemand naar het toilet ging, de deur open ging en wij ijskoud op de tocht zaten.Na het diner bestelde één van ons een irish coffee, die niet leverbaar bleek te zijn. Toen hij in plaats daarvan om een cognac vroeg, werd calvados geserveerd.Het eten zelf was prima.Goed dat u om deze feedback vraagt. Ik zal hem niet als review op het internet zetten. Ik kom waarschijnlijk nog wel eens terug als de verbouwing voorbij is en ik hoop dan dat mijn belangrijkste grief - de herrie - minder zal zijn.Vriendelijke groeten,Henk Foekemahenk.foekema@upcmail.nl"

Praktisch elk gerecht viel tegen, of teveel hoisin saus of graten. Maar ook de smaakjes en presentatie matig. Was de kok op vakantie? Ook de serveerder aan tafel rommelig en niet alert. Op de vraag of het had gesmaakt en onze lauwe ’mwah’ reactie, nam hij dat aan en deed er niks mee. Nee, wij zouden het niet (meer) aanbevelen. Benieuwd wat Hiske Versprille hierover zou zeggen."

Maar dat is ook het enigste verder bediening en de eigengemaakte dim Sum te Gek !! Zal blij zijn als het weer de laatste zondag van de maand is ! Heerlijk !!
formitable,nld,-1,food,"Erg smaakvolle dumplings, en grotendeels dus ook goed gedaan en voorbereid!Ik zou dit wel eerder aan Nederlanders aanbevelen dan Aziatische vrienden. De mayonnaise op dumplings en aanwezigheid van loempia's en edamame nemen het gevoel van authenticiteit snel weg. In zekere zin natuurlijk wel goede fusion dus :)Ons favoriete dim sum restaurant is Golden Phoenix in china town, Londen, en zou ik dus ook sterk aan willen raden ter inspiratie.Groeten,Mischa"

Dazu noch eine kleine Anmerkung: Der Laden war nicht voll und es liefen auch genügend Mitarbeiter rum, die uns jedoch nicht wirklich beachtet haben. Nach Bestellaufgabe ging es zwar recht flott bis wir Getränke & Essen hatten, jedoch waren die Mitarbeiter nicht wirklich freundlich, sondern eher genervt von dem was sie machen. Einzige Ausnahme: ein nettes Mädel, das uns später abkassiert hat. Sie hat sich auch für die lange Wartezeit entschuldigt, als wir ihr davon geschildert haben. Nun das positive: das Essen war wirklich top und die Auswahl an Bieren ist auch richtig klasse. Auf der Karte steht zu jedem Burger auch gleich ein Biertipp mit dabei. Die Lage direkt am Strand ist natürlich ein weiterer Pluspunkt. Und der Stil des Laden ist auch richtig cool und gemütlich. Die Preise sind zwar etwas höher, aber für die Produkt-Qualität und Lage bezahlt man dann auch gerne mal mehr."

google_mybusiness,eng,1,experience;food,I can't say enough good things about this place. It's truly remarkable. We went there three times during our stay in Amsterdam. All the seafood was incredible and fresh. We loved the appetizers. Everything from the sashimi special.. the salmon tartar and the octopus. Lots of choices for main courses. We had Dover sole... Branzino... Lobster... Scallops.. even the French fries were amazing.  The gluten free bread was also great. I can't comment on the desserts because I didn't have any but if the dessert is anything like the rest of the menu then you won't go wrong.  Make sure to make reservation or you could wait over an hour. We made that mistake one night but the food was so good that we bit the bullet and waited. It was well worth it. The one criticism if I had one would be that the weren't enough vegetable choices on the menu. I love veggies and couldn't really get enough of them around town. But that was pattern all over Amsterdam. Give it a try. You'll love it.

Contrary to Middletons stake house who employes unprepared waiters which very basic communication skills and sloppy clothes and not very hygienic.

Steaks always cooked perfectly, with an equal level of care taken over the sides. I feel they have sold out with these franchises though. The food at peterborough Middletons is terrible. Dried out salad, mayo with skin on it, frozen calamari, steak thats cooked from cold so only blue or well done are acheivable. Its so so bad and made worse by the fact that thd middletobs brand started so strong. They have apparently decided to try to capture the high street market instead of remain high end but unfortunately havent yet dropped their prices to reflect the drop in standards.The waiting staff were excellent though, and the sole earners of my 2 stars."

instagram,rus,1,reputation,"По вашим просьбам составила с большим удовольствием ТОП -парад ресторанов этого года! На фото ссылки👣 Брони-обязательны и сильно заранее!Amsterdam: рестораны хорошего европейского уровня, но со своей спецификой, непривычной российскому гостю. Многие сразу вычёркиваются из-за отсутствия просто хорошего обслуживания. Принимают заказ и не запоминают, что и кому. Ждать приходиться или очень долго или все слишком быстро и «в кучу». Детское меню в Голландии - это мясные шарики в передаренном кляре, коричневая картошка фри и майонез! Но есть 2 огненных места. The Seafood Bar - стильно, шумно, динамично, очень вкусно и много!!! И ресторан Cecconi’s Amsterdam в отеле Soho! Потрясающее итальянское меню, обслуживание великолепное, вечером играет фортепиано, в помещении свободно и красивый вид на канал через большие окна. Оооочень вкусно! Venice: Лучший ресторан в Венеции- “Do Forni” - больше не нужно никуда ходить! Расположен он  на улочке  Calle Specchieri📍в минуте ходьбы от площади Сан Марко. Официанты-это уровень высшего класса не только профессионализма, но и культуры общения: взрослые, достойные, уверенные!  Конечно, как и положено, в Венеции -все маленькое и тесное в помещении, но это так «по-итальянски»👌😍Устрицы -лучшие, что мы ели за всю поездку;Ризотто с морепродуктами - сочное, нежное, рис идеально сварен, морские составляющие все идеального качества! Сибас в соли,огромный морской суп, тирамису, панакота и беллини -👌 Florence: Для любителей мяса -настоящий Флорентийский стейк – это особый специалитет, которым гордится вся Италия, тосканский томатный суп, безупречный хлеб и антипасти с извсканной картой вин, то прямо в центре города можно посетить очень хороший ресторан - Cantinetta Antinori. Andorra: В Андорре очень вкусный ресторан в деревне Солдеу -Sol i Neu. Мидии в соусе Том Ям, Ризотто с чернилами каракатицы, устрицы в любое время дня и ночи, артишоки и другие испанский закуски, обслуживание на самом высоком уровне, винная карта👌Marbella: 📍 Los Abanicos, Calle Malaga 17, Benahavis, Malaga - писала подробно совсем недавно! Это такое место, которое вспоминаешь с глубоким вздохом и улыбкой! Просто восторг!!!...Продолжение в комментарии ⬇"

Bij terugkomst zagen we op het terras een aantal tafels en daar zijn we aan gaan zitten. Op een dwingende manier werd ons gevraagd nog geen plaats te nemen omdat een en ander nog afgeruimd moest worden, alle begrip. vervolgens vond de serveerster dat we teveel tafeltjes in beslag namen. We hadden er 5 voor 14 personen, dus wat mij betreft is dat helemaal niet zo overdreven. Ik reageerde op de serveerster maar die deed net of ze me niet hoorde en ging verder met t opnemen van de bestelling. Dit gaf mij geen prettig gevoel. Binnen een half uur hebben we ons drankje gedronken en verschillende bittergarnituren, mij lijkt dat dit dan toch meer dan prima dat we (een groot deel van) het terras gebruikten.

Good food BAD service , thanks for a terrible birthday dinner!"
yelp,eng,1,experience,This place rocks.. everything we had here was awesome. We went back 3 times while we were in Amsterdam and honestly I would fly there just to eat there
yelp,eng,1,experience,"After an afternoon of cocktails at the House of Bols we had lunch at The Seafood Bar. The seafood is all freshly caught, but also very expensive. If you avoid the seafood towers and lobster most entrees are under 30 euros.We each ordered a pot of the mussels. For 20 euros you get a heaping pot of mussels cooked in your choice of broth. My husband opted for the classic French style in white wine, garlic and cream while my sister and I selected the Asian style in coconut milk, lemongrass and coriander. I loved the combination of mussels in coconut milk and the lemongrass and coriander added such a pleasant fragrance to the dish. After pairing the meal with side salads and fries we left stuffed.While I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here I would recommend this spot if you're in the area visiting other sights. It's one of the better rated restaurants in the area and the mussels are delicious!"
yelp,eng,1,experience,"This was a fun, bustling place to have dinner. On a recent Thursday night, the restaurant was packed and we were glad we had made reservations.  We decided to go family style and share a fingerfood platter, mixed grill platter, fruits de mer, and king crab.  All of the seafood was excellent.  On the finger food platter were delicious chunks of the fried fish that would have come in the fish and chips entree.  I would come back here just for that fried fish alone.  Overall outstanding meal, with great service too."
yelp,eng,1,experience,The seafood bar in Amsterdam is excellent. Wonderful seafood and even better service. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Amsterdam.
yelp,eng,1,experience,"We wanted to eat seafood and all fingers seems to have pointed to the Seafood Bar. The line was long but the wait was all worth it! The food was great and the service too! Large portions too! Wait, what??? Are we still in Europe??? Craving satisfied!"
yelp,eng,1,experience,"We didn't make a reservation but only endured a short wait.  We squished 5 into a small space and ordered and enjoyed.  We ordered a large Fruits de Mer (finished it all!), fillet of cod fish and chips (crisp outer shell, moist dense cod inside with the famous dutch fries), the lobster pasta special (huge pasta portion with a good serving of lobster, creamy and. rich tomato sauce); French styled mussels (again a huge generous portion in a cute cauldron with Dutch fries); French fish soup which was filled with seafood and a light tomato base...next time the lobster bisque...The food is simply fantastic.  The service was prompt and quick to keep clearing shells and refilling water glasses.  A must stop if you are in town."
yelp,eng,1,experience,"Excellent oysters, grilled octopus, and crab cakes. Would come here again. Great drink choices as well."

facebook,eng,-1,environment,"So, I will vent here because not so long ago Ellis was my favorite burger place. While living in the Netherlands I had my first date with my bf there and since then it became our tradition to go back every special time. Now, living in Gent, the idea was keeping that alive, but things have gone sour. First of all, something that its quite sad, the fries, at least somewhere at the end of 2015 beginning of 2016 (while still in the NL) fries were proper potato wedges which later became the frozen normal fries you get in the frituur place... I know you still have the sweet potato wedges but apparently getting decent salty ones is no longer an option. It really gave you edge against other peasant places with the common fries. Secondly, why on earth did you remove your strawberry lemonade from the menu, you were the only place where I could find a decent lemonade that was not the disgusting syrope+water drink that you normally get on the kids' menu. I have tried the new hibiscus and other infusions but they are not comparable to the deceased strawberry lemonade. Thirdly, I have ordered at least 10 times on uber eats putting extra comments on adding an extra Ellis sauce which is worth of all my respects since I believe it is great (I LOVE THAT SAUCE) and adds a lot of value to either the burger or the already sad fries... but no... I cannot get the sauce in my order. Apparently, it is impossible for either the uber eats guy or the place to put it inside my bag. Does it have an extra cost?? let me know and I gladly pay it, however, when being in the establishment I have ordered extra sauce several times with no problem nor extra charge... so, what's up there? I just came back from one-month surgery recovery, and I ordered my usual, guess what, no sauce...If there was one thing I could have rescued from the new era would be the cheesecake with the bits of raspberry and chocolate, but guess what, last time I ordered it wasn't on my bag...Why guys!!! Please bring Ellis back to its shiny days... Sincerelya soon former fan of Ellis burger"

I enjoyed sitting and working for several hours and of course having a bite or a cup of coffee over my stay, etc. Sometimes I did not order anything as soon as I got here earlier in the morning, but later. Today I arrived in the coffee company around 8:30 am and after sitting and opening my laptop, someone came to me asking if I wanna order and I said, maybe later. So far so good! But he followed by saying something that implied either order or go out. This sounds very improper to me, perceiving a loyal customer as a potential free-rider. I even did not use their wifi most of the time. I won't come back to this place, as I reflected to the guy afterward on his talk. He replied ""Fair enough"" and did not correct himself, saying that I wouldn't change my mind anyways. Everything else is fine. The attached photo is my last cup of coffee, now."

Je personeel hoort je producten te kennen.Een autoverkoper rijd ook in de wagens die hij verkoopt.Plan een proefavond met je personeel, dit is heel leuk. je eten/drinken verkoopt zichzelf als personeel er met passie over spreekt.- De prijs kwaliteit was er goed, 40 euro incl. fooi voor 2 personen eten is zeer netjes. Persoonlijk mogen de borden wat meer aankleding / versiering krijgen:- denk aan gefrituurde schorseneren- radijs(onzin maar het geeft extra kleur en beleving)Gezien de huidige prijs kan die best omhoog en daar willen mensen wel voor betalen.Overal hebben we lekker gegeten.

We - 2 personen - zaten nog niet of er werd al gevraagd wat we wilden eten, en vooral wat we alvast wilden drinken. Bij het bezorgen van de eerste drankjes (binnen 2 minuten) wederom de vraag wat we wilden eten (menukaarten lagen er nog bij zoals we ze gekregen hadden). Let wel: hele restaurant was bijna leeg want iedereen zat buiten (een keuze die ons niet werd aangeboden alhoewel we wel gereserveerd hadden).Halfvolle glazen wilden ze weer meenemen. Ongeveer 30 seconden nadat de ene serveerster gevraagd had of we nog iets wilden drinken (nee) kwam de volgende hetzelfde vragen. We kregen het verkeerde dessert (""Oh"" was de reactie, geen excuses of toelichting - of haast om een nieuw dessert te halen zodat we het tegelijk konden opeten), en we kregen ook de verkeerde rekening (die we zelf moest geen halen omdat de drie dames opeens - ruim 10 minuten - geen drankjes meer kwamen verkopen of überhaupt nog naar onze tafel keken).Oftewel: een goed lesje in hoe je NIET gastvrij kunt zijn."

Sorry maar dit hoort niet  en bovendien erg onhygiënisch! Geen vers gebakken brood met smeersels meer zoals vroeger het geval was. Al met al deze keer een zeer teleurstellende ervaring!

formitable,eng,-1,food;innovation;value,Over all take away is that it’s too expensive for what it is or what it should be. Some of the food is unnecessarily complex in flavor and not necessary tasty. “Gourmet Gastro pub” you should address some “pub” basics. For example you don’t have a burger on the menu. Why not have an amazing burger on the menu? Would be more indicative of a Gastro pub. Price for value is very poor.  By the way  this is coming from someone who is from New York and think of myself as a bit of a foodie or food enthusiast.

formitable,nld,-1,food;service,"Goed- Eten was doorgaans prima.- Op zich vriendelijk personeel.Kan beter- We hebben erg lang aan tafel gezeten wat volgens mij niet per se nodig was gezien de gerechten.- De service kon beter. Voorbeeld. Ik wilde groene thee bij het dessert en een tafelgenote ook. De serveerster stelde voor om ons een kannetje thee te geven. Prima, maar het is dan jammer als er erg weinig in die kan zit (ik kreeg er geen twee fatsoenlijke koppen uit). Dan heb ik liever geen kan maar gewoon meteen een kop. We kregen overigens wel een nieuwe kan toen we daarom vroegen maar erg handig is het niet.- De friet was vaak nogal kort, vettig, en zout. Ik had daar meer van verwacht."
formitable,eng,-1,service;food,"I’ve never eaten at Ron Gastrobar before so this was a first experience. We came for lunch and decided to get the 6 course menu. This dish started out well however that soon changed. The tartar had no seasoning and was very neutral in flavor. The lamb ravioli was a very disappointing dish and both of us did not Finishing eating the dish. The flavor combination was all too confusing and the watermelon water on the bottom just didn’t make sense at all. The feta mousse as the waiter explained, just over powered everything and the lamb itself was just flavorless. When explained this to one of our many different waiters, the comment was ignored and brushed off. The waiter then returned and offered only my friend a free wine in the house. No reaction towards me. A second waiter arrived with the wine she had selected and explained to my friend that the wine was for free due to us having to wait so long for our dishes. ????? Yes it was taking some time but that was not the reasoning for the wine in the first place. The dessert at the end was just disappointing, a supposed signature dish which fell very short of enjoyable. It was more based on its looks than its actual content. Our many waiters, this for me was a constant irritation. Every dish was served by someone different also since we always communicate with someone different our requests just didn’t get communicated between each other. A very insensitive service"

formitable,eng,1,service;food;experience,The food lovely however I would have liked bread or biscuits with the foie gras as it was hard to eat on its own. The rest was amazing. The space between courses was very well timed too. Thank you for a lovely evening.

formitable,eng,1,experience;service;food,Thankyou for a fantastic night. Everything was perfect.
formitable,eng,1,experience;service,Me and my wife had a weekend in Amsterdam at her 30th birtday and visited Ron Gastrobar. The food was great and the staff friendly snd helpful. The restaurant as a whole is Quite laid back but still high quality of all the dishes.  When we were done and wanted to pay it was hard tog get any attention so we ended up paying in the bar. Apart from this it was a great experience!
formitable,nld,1,service;experience,"Nieuwe gerechten op de kaart voor ons(laatste keer in mei geweest) en vonden deze echt top. Meer structuren on de gerechten vond wij. Dit maal uitstekende bediening, zeer attent."
formitable,eng,1,experience;food;service,"We spent a fantastic evening with top creative dishes, good priced wine and really good service. Recommendable Restaurant for a relaxed evening."
formitable,eng,1,experience;food;service,"My husband and I dined at Ron Gastrobar on my birthday, while vacationing in Amsterdam. I had wanted to try one of the Michelin restaurants, but wanted something less formal than many I had looked at online. Ron Gastrobar turned out to be exactly what I was looking for. The setting was lovely but casual and the food was extraordinary. We chose the 6 course set meal after finding we would be able to change one of the courses we weren't keen on to something we found more appealing. Every course was delicious and we were given time in between to be ready to enjoy the next selection. The service was wonderful and our servers explained every course to us in detail. I've already recommended the restaurant to a friend who was coming to Amsterdam this month. Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
formitable,eng,1,service;experience,"We had a delicious meal, complemented by good service and wine recommendations from our waitress. There was a unreasonably long delay to serve the large course, and the again dessert, which was unfortunate."
formitable,eng,0,service;environment,Food was beautifully and tasteful prepared. The service did not hold that same niveau as the waiter had too many tables to take care of. Overall a good experience but I would not go again.Problem however was the overall sound level. Restaurant should install sound reducing measures as we had to literally scream st each other.

formitable,eng,1,experience;food;service,"Our first impressions of the restaurant certainly misled our expectations.  The service was friendly and efficient. We were impressed that the waiters knew about one of our party’s allergies and took care to double check with the kitchen once we ordered.  The food is fantastic.  Mostly familiar dishes arrived and all of them were far better than we could have expected.  Although the wine we had was delicious, I felt that the list as a whole was fairly short."
formitable,nld,1,food;experience;service,Wij hebben super genoten van de heerlijke gerechtjes en de lekkere wijn! En ook de bediening was top; enthousiast en vriendelijk. Wij vinden het elke keer weer een feestje om bij Ron Gastrobar te eten.
formitable,nld,1,experience;service,"Superleuke avond gehad. We vierden ons 10 jarig huwelijk en zonder erom te vragen werden we verrast met champagne vooraf een vuurwerk bij het toetje. Erg leuk, vooral het feit dat de gehele bediening op de hoogte was van ons jubileum. Daarnaast was het menu smakelijk en goed oo elkaar afgestemd. In totaal 3.5 uur puur genot en plezier. Tot een volgende keer!"
formitable,nld,1,experience;food;service,"Super lekker gegeten en echt weer heerlijk nieuwe top gerechten; kom graag bij jullie eten.MaarDe rose was lauw op zijn best de eerste ronde en niet lekker. Hebben we ijsblokje in gedaan maar ik zou gezegd hebben sorry meneer; die krijgt u van ons en de volgende is koud. Dat was daarna ook inderdaad zo.We hebben in totaal 5 glazen op wat EUR 50 kost; was een fles dan niet handiger geweest en hadden ze dat bij aanvang niet even moeten melden. Had handiger gekund en vond de drank nu wel kostbaar. Toen Robin de bediening verder weer overnam liep het gesmeerd en hij blijft een topper die alles tot in de puntje regelt voor de gast aan tafel. Ik kom zeker weer hoor maar wilde deze feedback toch even delen. Groeten, Frank"

Mooie tent ook: sfeervol ingericht, open keuken is altijd goed en mijn vrouw had schik in de anekdotes van de Luizenmoeder die ze op het toilet hoorde. De ietswat onhandige tafelpoot waardoor je weinig ruimte hebt voor je benen en de hoeveelheid geluid (akoestiek?) mogen de pret van de totale beleving niet drukken. Aanrader!(Translated by Google)Every dish is a party! We had the 6-course menu where you fell from one surprise to the other. Matching wine with every dish made it complete.

Wij gaan regelmatig op restaurant en wat ons aanspreekt is met name de bediening. Deze is, net als in Ron Gastrobar, informeel maar aangenaam. Je voelt je echt welkom!"

We moesten elke keer wenken om de aandacht te trekken, om te bestellen etc. Geen hartelijkheid, alleen verplicht glimlachen. Einde avond niemand om jassen te geven of uitgeleide te doen.

Het viel ons op dat er wel een beetje weinig witte rijst werd geserveerd voor het aantal gasten waarmee we waren.

Dat krijg je misschien door het openen van meerdere restaurants.De eerste 4 x dat ik bij Ron ben gaan eten, waren qua beleving, ook de beste 4x.  Maar buiten dit, kom ik zeker weer terug."
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,"Wij hebben echt heerlijk gegeten gisteren. Alles was zeer uitgebalanceerd. De nieuwerwetse twist aan de gerechten was formidabel.Wij vonden de bediening iets te snel. Voorbeeld: mijn man vroeg wat voor wijn er werd ingeschonken. Antwoord: 'hele lekkere uit Nieuw Zeeland'. En toen werd het glas vol geschonken en was de ober meteen weg. Wij verwachten hier eigenlijk een andere aanpak. Even laten proeven, wachten of de wijn gewaardeerd wordt etc. Ten slotte, vonden wij de akoestiek van de ruimte (Amstelzijde) aan de achterkant links, waar wij zaten, niet geweldig."

formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,"We hebben heerlijke a la carte menu besteld.  Opmerkelijk was de airco op die avond een beetje te koud was, waardoor onze eten heel snel koud werd. Het zou misschien een oplossing kunnen zijn voor a la carte menu in een kleinere porties doen, zodat ze ook op een verwarmplaat kunnen passen. Of anders de ruimte iets warmer instellen."

formitable,nld,1,experience;service,Uitgebreide rijsttafel gekozen. Heerlijk m.u.v. de visgerechtjes. De rijsttafel zonder vis was voor ons een betere keus geweest. Tafeltjes te klein en erg dicht op elkaar. Ik hoef echt niet het gesprek van de buren te kunnen volgen.

Serveerders waren vriendelijk en gaven uitleg bij de kaart en gerechten. We bestelden de uitgebreide rijsttafel. Het eten werd heel snel gebracht (nog geen 10 min). De lekkerste gerechten vonden wij de garnalen en sate (bbq smaak en lekkere saus). Zeer smaakvol en authentiek bereid. De overige gerechten waren okay maar de rund stoof was redelijk droog en de groenten in kokos bouillon een beetje flauw van smaak. Nasi was trouwens heel erg lekker en de atjar ook lekker zuur en zout. Al met al een goede combinatie van gerechten. Als toetje de pannenkoek met mango ijs genomen. Verrassend qua smaak en goede portie. Borden zijn mooi opgemaakt. We zullen zeker een keer terug komen maar dan a la carte bestellen.

formitable,nld,-1,food;service,"Een rijsttafeltje delen voor 31.50 pp is behoorlijk duur. Wat je ervoor krijgt is nogal gewoontjes (zelfs de witte rijst plakt in 3 grote brokken in een kommetje). De bediening raffelt in 1 minuut onverstaanbaar af wat er in de schaaltjes zit. Bij binnenkomst bieden ze water aan maar dat blijkt vervolgens geen karaf kraanwater maar een fles a 6,50."

Er was dus kennelijk wat verwarring ontstaan bij aanvang, dit werd goed opgelost. Wellicht omdat we vroeg waren, 17:00 uur.We hadden besloten om stap voor stap te bestellen en dat was een goed plan. Begonnen eerst met de verrassingsbox, tevens aangevuld met oesters. Heerlijk, goede smaken, mooi opgediend. Het gezelschap bestelde daarna een kleine soto ayam (ik paste even), ook hier weer, rijk gevuld met kip, de soep werd in het kommetje aan tafel ingeschonken. Ik sloot weer aan bij de hoofdgerechten, al moet ik eerlijk toegeven niet deel te nemen aan alle gerechten. Ik had trek in de side dish, tempé tumis. Helaas niet naar verwachting. Ik had iets verwacht wat ik niet proefde, het was puur kecap manis wat ik proefde. Teleurgesteld en gaf het ook door aan het personeel. De overige gerechten waren ok, te veel saus erbij.

formitable,nld,1,experience;food;service,Wij aten met een groep van 14. De service was super. Sfeer was goed en het eten heerlijk. Echt een top restaurant om met een groep te eten. Dat is vaak soms lastig in andere restaurants. Bedankt! We hebben een heerlijke avond gehad.
formitable,nld,-1,service,"Bediening had geen overzicht.Lang wachten op zowel drankjes, koffie als op de rekening. Wijn op rekening die we miet hadden gehad. Vies koffiekopje. Dure fles water verkopen tereijl wij in de veronderstelling waren een karaf kraanwater te krijgen....Eten was redelijk."
formitable,eng,1,experience;service,"We bring friends here every time that they visit us.  Great food and we especially enjoyed the very good service we had when we came for an early dinner, including a complimentary taste from the chef.  Thank you and great time!"
formitable,eng,1,experience;service,"Hi, rijstafel was awesome as usual. The only comment I have is we signed up for business dinner (%20 discount) but it wasn't reflected to the bill. When we paid the check it was past 7.30 , maybe that's the reason. Regardless I love all Ron restaurants."
formitable,eng,0,food;service,"We had a great meal with two different satés, the fried wontons, and rice. Although the food was delicious, our server was not very attentive. He forgot our drink order, and we waited 20 minutes to receive the menus. It’s too bad because the Host was very nice, and the food great but because of the service from our waiter we will not return."

formitable,nld,0,experience;environment,"Heerlijk eten, fantastische bediening, prachtige locatie! Jammer is dat je dan bij binnenkomst in de lift en bij de ontvangstbalie een muur van rioollucht door moet omdat er iets verstopt zit. Een ook het sanitair was niet spik en span. Mensen, doe er wat aan, die binnenkomst is je visitekaartje en voor de rest is het zó top!"
formitable,nld,1,experience;food,"Uit Groningen gekomen om hier te gaan eten, en het smaakte net zo lekker als dat we gedacht hadden. De rib-eye is een aanrader. Naast het lekkere eten was ook de bediening erg netjes en spontaan."

formitable,nld,-1,value,Iets te duur voor wat je krijgt. Bediening was traag. Decor was wel top!

formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,Voor het eerst met een vriendinnetje wezen eten. Moment dat de deur binnenloopt is al wauw. Wat een mooie tent! En het eten is overheerlijk. Ik eet veel Indisch bij mijn familie en dit kan eraan tippen! Kom zeker gauw weer terug.

formitable,nld,1,environment;food,"De rijsttafel was heerlijk, entertainment was geniaal!"
formitable,nld,1,experience;food,"Gisteren heb ik de verjaardag van mijn vriend bij Ron Gastrobar downtown gevierd. Eerder al bij Ron Gastrobar Indonesia geweest in Oude Kerk aan de Amstel.  Doordat we allebei enthousiast waren over het concept daar, wilden we dit allebei een keer uitproberen In downtown was de sfeer heel anders, maar zeker ook zeker op een positieve manier.  Het eten was van  goede kwaliteit en de service was top! Door de zeer attente personeel en extraatjes,  voelde dit als een hele andere beleving die we nog niet elders hebben gehad. Hier wordt niet alleen naar het eten gekeken, het gaat hier om het totaal plaatje en dat maakt Ron Gastrobar downtown zo bijzonder. Echt een aanrader!"
formitable,nld,1,environment;service;food,Fijne bediening en heerlijk eten!
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,"Lang geleden dat ik ergens ben geweest waar alles zo klopt. Van de ontvangst tot aan de bediening en locatie, alles overtreft de verwachtingen. Dan het belangrijkste, het eten, ook hier overtreft het alle verwachtingen! De herkenbare Indonesische keuken met een verassende twist. Wij komen zeker nog eens terug!"
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;environment,"Ik was aangenaam verrast toen we binnenkwamen. Personeel deed er alles aan om ons welkom te laten voelen en gedurende het gehele diner was de service goed. De ""show"" met sambal en hot towels; you love or you hate it denk ik maar ik vond het wel grappig. Het was behoorlijk warm aan de kant waar we zaten en helaas konden we niet naar de andere kant verplaatst worden maar dat heeft de avond verder niet beïnvloed. Het eten (de rijsttafel) was erg smakelijk en divers. Een puntje van kritiek is dat als iemand van het personeel aanbiedt de rijst of nasi aan te vullen ik eigenlijk niet verwacht dat er dan 6 euro extra voor in rekening gebracht wordt. Maar al met al zeker een 2e bezoek (met niet Amsterdamse gasten) waard."
formitable,nld,1,reputation;experience,Groupon bon voor rijsttafel lunch voor 2 personen. Echt waanzinnig lekker en heel hoog op smaak. Erg veel waar voor je geld. Wel irritant dat de bediening erg nadrukkelijk je een voorafje probeerde te verkopen. Terwijl we de rijsttafel niet op konden.
formitable,nld,1,experience;service,Heerlijke rijsttafel gehad. Goeie sfeer en leuke bediening.
formitable,nld,1,experience;environment;service,"Van het interieur tot de menukaart en de gastvrije (informele) benadering, alles was perfect geregeld. Medewerkers voelden goed aan wat we wilden :-). Het eerste uur was de muziek een allegaartje met zelfs een trance remix van Lady Gaga's Shallow tussendoor, dat vond ik wel wat afdoen aan de sfeer. Verder: helrmaal top!"
formitable,nld,1,experience;service;food,Leuk gegeten en hele leuke sfeer. Bediening was ook onwijs goed! Heel fijn.
formitable,nld,1,reputation;experience;food,"Zijn altijd ontzettend te vrede over elk restaurant van Ron.Moet wel eerlijk zijn dat de bediening vandaag iets minder was dan gebruikelijk, maar dat gebeurt altijd wel eens. Verder weer tip genoten"
formitable,nld,1,experience;food,"Bij binnenkomst werden we ontvangen in een prachtige ruimte die mij direct het idee gaven in Indonesië te zijn door de muziek, de geuren en de aankleding. Vervolgens worden we met de lift omhoog gestuurd. Al het personeel is ontzettend vriendelijk. Het is een prachtige plek met een enorm leuke aankleding, een open keuken, gestroomlijnd personeel, live muziek en het eten was fantastisch. We hadden een alcoholvrije cocktail besteld en ook die was heerlijk. Het enige minpuntje is dat we geen plek meer hadden voor een dessert. Ik vond het echt een top beleving en ik zou dit zeker aanraden bij iedereen. Bedankt voor deze geweldige avond!"
formitable,nld,1,environment;experience,Heerlijk gegeten en prachtige locatie 👍
formitable,nld,1,reputation;experience,Wat een feestje om hier een rijsttafel te eten. Het is een prachtige locatie en je voelt je echt een middag uit. Bediening heel attent en vriendelijk. Het eten was heerlijk en een raadsel waarom het op een zaterdag niet ramvol zit.
formitable,nld,1,experience;food,Wij hebben heerlijk genoten van meerdere kleinere gerechten. Leuk om zo kennis te mogen maken van verschillende gerechten. Ik had aangegeven dat mijn vriend jarig was en we werden ook gefeliciteerd. Maar had het leuk gevonden dat er aandacht aan werd besteed. Tafel naast ons kreeg bv een drankje van het huis (omdat het bekende Nederlanders waren). Had verwacht dat hij ook in het zonnetje gezet werd maar helaas. Nog wel lekker nagetafeld met lekkere nagerecht en heerlijke cocktails. Leuke locatie!
formitable,nld,1,experience;service,het was weer geweldig en mijn gasten waren zeer enthousiastkomende zaterdag 31Augustus hebben wij weer een tafel geboekt voor 4 personen met andere klanten en hopen weer op jullie kook en amusements kunsten te kunnen rekenengraag een tafel weer aan de podium kantmet dankgerard ter bruggen
formitable,nld,1,experience;service,"Beste Ron Gastrobar,Een tijd geleden gegeten in jullie vestiging in Haarlem. Dat was top! Vervolgens gingen wij vol verwachting naar Ron Gastrobar Indonesia Downtown. Supermooie locatie en prachtig ingericht. De prijs en de kwaliteit van het eten viel erg tegen. Voor ons de eerste en laatste  keer."
formitable,nld,1,reputation;service;experience,"Fijne en hartelijke ontvangst!. Prachtige ruimte met centraal de grote open keuken en een grote bar. Mooie architectuur op bovenste verdieping van Hudson Bay. Veel licht en ruimte, stijlvol ingericht. De rijsttafel (lunch) was heerlijk. Sommige gerechten konden nog wat Indonesischer.... saté gambing (was van lam, geen geit...) mag langer gemarineerd worden om de smaak er in te laten trekken. Ook de sajur lodeh miste karakter. De wijnen wat aan de prijzige kant, zeker per glas. Service prima! Sambal kar is grappig maar geeft geen echte meerwaarde, beetje te veel een “attractie”..... Zonder meer aanbevelingswaardig."
formitable,nld,1,experience;food,Goed!
google_mybusiness,nld,1,experience;service;food,"Dit restaurant is echt een aanrader! Wij hebben verschillende voorgerechten gegeten en als hoofd gerechten Franse mosselen in wijnsaus, zalm van de plaat en Zeeuwse oesters. Voor een dessert was geen plaats meer gezien de porties vrij groot zijn. Daarnaast een sauvignon Blanc. We mochten de wijn eerst proeven alvorens een keuze te maken tussen de verschillende  soorten wijnen. Het personeel wist overigens veel te vertellen over de wijnkaart. De styling van het restaurant past goed bij het menu. Daarnaast was het sanitair schoon. Prijs kwaliteit dikke prima. Het personeel vond ik super aardig, beleefd en men controleert tijdig of er nog wensen zijn. Het oogt wel of er onwijs veel personeel is, waarschijnlijk is dit nodig. Bovenal is de vis vers en kan je het ook in het restaurant bekijken. Ik kom er zeker terug! Shout out for Teddy en Corne!"

formitable,nld,0,experience;value,"Wij hebben prima bij u gegeten, laat dat eerst gezegd zijn.Wij eten graag buiten de deur en het mag ook best wat kosten.Wij vonden de kwaliteit zeker niet laag, maar het zesgangenmenu voor 65 euro vonden wij overprijsd.De Sum dim sum en de La zi yu vonden wij heerlijk, de overige gerechten niet met voldoende karakter, wat een vlakke Pekingeend! De La chao yang xin rou vonden wij ronduit mislukt, storend veel te zout. Het surprise-ei vonden wij bijzonder matig, te eentonig en een beetje kinderachtig.De prijs hoeft niet omlaag, verbetert u liever de kwaliteit! Voor 65 euro exclusief wijn kan elders aanzienlijk beter gegeten worden."
formitable,nld,1,experience;service,Het was voor mij de tweede keer dat ik bij Downtown at. De entourage is geweldig. De hele avond is een groot feest met allemaal verassingen. Je wordt echt in de watten gelegd. Daarnaast zijn het eten en de drankjes geweldig. Omdat je graag zo lang mogelijk van de sfeer wilt genieten is het alleen jammer dat het eten zo snel komt. Daarom hebben wij onze ober gevraagd of het eten iets later gebracht kon worden. Dat was gelukkig geen probleem.
formitable,nld,0,food;environment,Zoals ik al aangeef in de titel was het eten echt erg goed:-) en ook weer anders dan in Ouderkerk. Jammer dat de muziek ondanks de verschillende pogingen van het bedienend personeel simpel te hard staat voor een normaal gesprek.
formitable,nld,1,experience;food,Prima ervaring maar wel.met wat minpunten:● het restaurant is leeg toen wij aankwamen terwijl de lunch tussen 12 en 14 is.● 1 serveerster spreekt geen Ned en erg gebrekkig engels● het eten is echt in no time koud en dat was waardeloos.Lokatie was prima ..maar het geeft geen Ron Blauw gevoel ...
formitable,eng,0,environment;service,The ground floor as you enter the lift stinks of sewage. Tables far too small for a rijsttafel setting making the experience cramped.
formitable,nld,1,service;experience;food,"Lekker gegeten, met creatieve varianten op Indonesische gerechten. Vooral de eend en de tonijntartaar bevielen ons (afgezien van de sateetjes natuurlijk). Wat wel opviel: er staan niet zoveel kleine groentegerchtjes op de streetfood kaart, waardoor het allemaal wel wat vlezig is.En oh ja: de tafeltjes staan net iets te dicht bij elkaar, je bent nu wel heel erg in contact met je buren."
formitable,nld,-1,food,"Zijn regelmatig aan de Amstel geweest, nu Amsterdam gedaan. Prachtige zaak!Punt is niet ideaal, maar oké . We vonden het eten minder als aan de Amstel. Niet alleen qua hoeveelheid, ook presentatie, en smaak. JammerBediening oké. We hadden voorgerechten “streetfood” . Erg weinig voor 10 euro! Smaak was heerlijk! Al met al: leuk voor 1 keer, maar niet nog een keer."

formitable,nld,1,reputation;food;environment,Een geweldige Early Bird rijsttafel gegeten. Alle gerechten hadden hun eigen authentieke smaak. Heerlijke Virgin cocktail er bij. En zeer aangename ambiance. Super om vanuit het werk dit te kunnen te doen met een aantrekkelijke korting. Zeker voor herhaling vatbaar.
formitable,nld,1,service;experience,"Wederom niet teleurgesteld! Heerlijke rijsttafel in een mooie ambiance met leuke bediening en muziek. Enige gerechtje wat een beetje tegenviel deze keer was de Sojoer Lodeh, die wat flauw was met weinig smaak, vandaar geen 10."

formitable,nld,-1,food,Ik vond  de kaart te beperkt in keuze.
formitable,nld,1,food;environment;service,"Bij binnenkomst was de verwachting hoog. Super vriendelijke ontvangst, keurige service. Attent personeel. Geweldige sfeer, met live muziek. We waanden ons echt in een high end restaurant in Jakarta. Dit hebben jullie echt goed weten de benaderen. De outfits van het personeel deden me wat koloniaal aan, een Javaans tenue had beter gepast. Toen de gerechten op tafel kwamen, zag alles er heerlijk uit. Goede wijn ook! (Sancerre). Het eten echter viel echt tegen. De gerechten hadden niet de smaak explosie of sensatie die de Indonesische keuken kent, en waren al helemaal niet te vergelijken met “street food”. Dit was echt te voorzichtig qua smaak. Veel gerechten hadden de zelfde ketjap saus. Het was absoluut niet pittig (voor de Nederlandse smaak misschien ook gevaarlijk maar een beetje pit mag wel in de indo keuken.) We misten echt de authentieke smaak. Nu ben ik / zijn wij heel veel Indonesisch eten gewend, dus dat blijft lastig. Maar ik hoop echt dat jullie er in slagen het eten op niveau te krijgen door Indonesische koks aan te nemen. Want aan de rest van de aspecten ligt het niet. Complimenten hiervoor."

formitable,eng,1,reputation;environment;food;service,"We went there for lunch with a 5 year old child. Three of us was put in a small table for two, and the rice table is quite big, we must squeezed ourself to finish the lunch.The rice table looks fine, but 35 eu per person is too much expensive. Although there are 15 small bowls of different dishes, there are no focuses. Three or four dishes have a few peaces of meat, which is a pity because the portion (considered as main course) is simply too little, even for starter!My advice? You do not need 15 dishes. Less is fine as long as each dish is (quantitative) large enough for enjoying it. So people remember/impressed by what they eat."
formitable,nld,1,food;reputation;service,"Lokatie, inrichting en decoratie goed.Bediening en snelheid goed.Entertainment te luid, Mr Spicy top.Rijsttafel voor twee matig. Garnalen veel te hard gefrituurd, geitensate te taai. Gado gado zonder boontjes."

Dit is niet Ron Blauw waardig. Personeel met zichtbare tatoeages (met WW2 tekeningen)."

Na een speciale wens te hebben geplaatst bij mijn reservering werd ik gelijk gemaild met opties voor een feestelijk diner. Alles tot in de puntjes geregeld op de avond zelf! Super goede service en vriendelijke bediening. Het eten was heerlijk en werd mooi gepresenteerd. Tijdens ons diner was er ook live muziek dat maakte de avond helemaal compleet.

Voorgerecht (taco's)....vergeten, aperitif kwam na 3x vragen ongeveer gelijk met de rijsttafel, daarna liet hij bij afnemen vies bestek op kleding van mijn gast vallen (geen excuses) en liet daarna (voor een andere tafel een blad op de grond vallen, direct bij onze tafel. 2x om de rekening moeten vragen. Deze keer geen fooi zoals u begrijpt."

formitable,nld,1,reputation;experience;food;service,Het eten was prima.. vooral streetfood vooraf was overheerlijk. Bediening goed maar wel wat vaak aan tafel (drie keer vragen “zijn jullie uit gegeten” terwijl we nog met bestek in onze handen zaten.. Jammer ook dat je vroege vork boekt en de korting niet op de rekening staat. Nooit leuk dat je er alsnog om moet vragen.

Meer dat het een fancy tent is: hip, stijlvol ingericht, mooi opgediend, een hele toffe sfeer. Life muziek, veel cocktails. Bediening is ok, zien er mooi uit. Maar het eten is redelijk. Heb er nu 2x gegeten met m’n neef (flight attendant uit de usa) en hij vindt t daar en bij kantjil geweldig. Ik minder: De gado gado bijvoorbeeld bestond uit taugé en witte kool en er lag maar 1 boontje in 🤷🏼‍♀️ Wel met de goede gado gado saus en emping maar zonder stukjes gekookt ei. Er was geen bami goreng?? De nasi was quite ok. De saté babi bestond uit vierkante blokjes maar heel droog, de ajam lekker en de s kambing erg lekker. De tjendol vind ik net anders smaken dan ie hoort te zijn: niet authentiek. Maar je kunt er bvd wel oesters en tonijn eten: fancy smaakvolle voorgerechten.Al met al leuke ervaring / atmosfeer en als je indo bent, kan t eten ietwat tegenvallen."

Het duurt erg lang voordat er iemand langskomt op drankjes op te nemen. Ook op het einde toen ik om de rekening vroeg zeker 5 minuten moeten wachten op het doosjes met de rekening. Direct gezegd dat ik wilde pinnen, en er zou zo iemand komen met pinapparaat. Echter 15 minuten later nog steeds niets, dus toen zijn we maar naar de uitgang gelopen en heeft daar iemand een pinapparaat geregeld."

formitable,nld,1,experience;service,"Eten bij Ron Gastrobar is niet alleen eten. Het gaat verder dan dat. Het begint al bij binnenkomst van de zaak en de meer dan prima ontvangst door de placeuse. Jij als bezoeker staat centraal. De muzikale omlijsting was prima. De muziekstijl laat zich als beste omschrijven als een mengelmoes van soul/r&b/disco/pop. Niet te overheersend maar precies goed.De tafelbediende adviseerde ons prima en wat ze zei was niet gelogen... het eten was voortreffelijk. Op een goed tempo zodat wij goed met elkaar konden praten en/of genieten van de muziek.Er hangt een leuke vibe in het restaurant/bar. Niet alleen door het interieur, verlichting en uitzicht. Nee, het personeel zijn de ware sterren. Zij zorgen ervoor dat alles soepel verloopt en het jou als klant aan niets ontbreekt.Voor een leuke avond uit en een unieke beleving zouden wij dit restaurant aan iedereen willen aanbevelen."

Het is altijd een geweldige ervaring: het eten is fantastisch, de plaats is geweldig en de service is ook indrukwekkend. De rijstafel is heerlijk en de desserts en wijn ook. Het enige dat kan worden verbeterd (naar mijn mening) is de prijs van het water (6 € voor een fles SPA, het is belachelijk). Anders dan dat, absoluut aan te bevelen"
formitable,nld,1,experience;food;value,"Mooi restaurant, vriendelijke bediening. Jammer dat je in de middag niet alle cocktails kan bestellen en ook de Brut Rose (8,50 per glas) was op. Er was nog wel gewone Brut maar die was 13,50 per glas. Vind ik wel een heel groot prijsverschil.Wij hadden de rijsttafel, wel lekker allemaal, maar niet super bijzonder.

google_mybusiness,eng,-1,experience;food;service,"Food for all three of us was below average. I’m guessing the couple that were not in uniform were the owners. She seemed to have her act together and took control.He strolled around like he owned the place. After our ok meal, three guys walk in expecting to be sat right away. The owner guides his eyes towards us and continues to hover making eye contact with me like I should be in a hurry to give up our spots.He actually tells them five minutes their table will be ready. They show up 3 minutes later and show their displeasure as the owner and the three see we are now having a coffee.He actually goes to the trouble of verbalizing it to the three who are a bit rough around the edges. (They needed a bottle of wine to get through the five minute wait). The owner apologized to them and continued to look our way until we left.When I found out this was a chain, it wasn’t a shock, food and service fit the bill."

Total bill for five people with wine, drinks and dessert came to EUR 170, which is very reasonable for Amsterdam.The food quality is great and the portions are generous. The staff are very friendly and responsive.

Turns out almost as expensive as the 6-course tasting menu (for 2 persons). On the bright side, the tasting menu probably is a better option. Love the omelette and mussels. Spareribs taste very like cha siu (sorry, I am from HK) so probably the most expensive cha siu i ever had (personal bias. To be fair, it tastes good). Lobster totally turn the good experience round as both the lobster and the side dish are not as tasty as I expect. Cocktails are amazing."

yelp,eng,1,experience;food;reputation,"We came to The Seafood Bar Spui after seeing their stellar reviews and I'm so glad we did. It was the best meal we had during our week long Amsterdam trip. It was absolutely a seafood feast!We went on a Friday for dinner and it was very busy with both tourists and locals. Luckily we were able to grab two seats at the bar. So make a reservation to secure a table if you go. We ordered a combination for two with both hot and cold seafood and we were very happy with our choice. We were amazed with the food amount and variety. For a similar meal in NYC, you'd looking to chipping in at least 150 bucks before taxes and tips. The combination was well worth it and you got to taste the best of both worlds. Between the two of us, we got to share a whole lobster (half chilled, half hot sautéed), two types of fish (one filet and one whole), tons of mussels, clams (including my favorite razor clams too!), shrimps, oysters, crabs, calamari, etc. Literally anything seafood you could think of were presented. And the menu is so flexible that you can mix and match to get different combinations to satisfy your appetite. Everything was super fresh and top notch quality. We especially enjoyed shell fishes such as mussels and clams. For the mussels back home in the US, I could not think of any other cooking method than boiling them in white wine to remove the fishy taste. Oh man, the mussels over here were simply steamed and chilled, but did not taste fishy at all. It was in fact so clean and sweet. I feel my vocabulary fell short here and cannot precisely describe how amazing it was - you gotta have to try yourself."

Waited for 45 mins to get the food that they got wrong three times. The veal vitello a limone was like rubber and had to be returned. The Napoli pasta which came with the escalope used tinned tomatoes and had no seasoning. There is clearly no communication between the waiters and the kitchen.

We visited the one on Ken High St today and I wasn't disappointed. It's a lovely little place which I know does get very busy at times but today later in the afternoon it was quiet. I had bread and olives. The bread was amazing. Lots of it focaccia, bread sticks, a thin crisp bread, almost like a popadum and ciabatta. The waiter left olive oil and balsamic so you could mix it as you like. A good idea. Then I had margheria pizza and a bottle of Moretti. The service was very good. The bill was about £45 but considering you are right in the centre not too bad at a. This restaurant is handy for the park and museums, Albert hall especially. I would recommend it. I imagine it's best to book over weekend evenings. Oh and finally the olives were stone in."

We moeten eerlijk; wij zijn helemaal niet op de hoogte van een slechte service te Brugge. We krijgen zelfs heel leuke reviews van onze locatie daar, vandaar dat dit bericht dus ook voor ons heel verrassend komt. Nu, je bent als klant 5x gaan eten te Bavet Brugge, weet dus dat we dit bericht uiterst serieus nemen en we uw opmerkingen dan ook volledig geloven.We profileren ons als een Fast-casual spaghetti collectie waar beleving en vriendelijke service centraal staan. We kunnen lezen dat je onze spaghetti lekker vindt en daar zijn we natuurlijk heel blij mee, maar laten we focussen op de slechte service waarover u het heeft. Het is bij ons een standaard om mensen te begroeten met een glimlach, op tijd mensen aan te spreken en ze dan ook te voorzien van een menukaart & drinks, dat weten onze mensen in de zaken zeker en vast. Weet dat we dit heel nauwkeurig met Core- & management team zullen opvolgen, want voor een restaurant waar, zoals gezegd, beleving en service centraal staan, hoort dit niet! Al geven we u ook volledig gelijk dat dit basis principes zijn om aan horeca te doen.Nogmaals hartelijk bedankt voor dit bericht. Dit wordt meteen met het team in Brugge besproken en wij zorgen dan ook voor een verandering hierin.Vriendelijke groeten!"

Maar de service was echt slecht, zo jammer want dit maakt het gelijk een mindere ervaring. We hadden bij het eten gelijk om extra gebakken rijst gevraagd, toen het eten bijna op was moesten we het opnieuw vragen want het was vergeten. Oké, kan gebeuren. Tot 2 keer toe zaten we lang met lege glazen en we hebben zeker 45 min lang met een lege rijsttafel voor ons gezeten. Er liep wel personeel maar ze kéken niet eens hoe het er voor stond op onze tafel. Uiteindelijk maar om de rekening gevraagd. Ik neem altijd een dessert maar door het gebrek aan aandacht en het lang moeten wachten had ik hier geen zin meer in. De rekening werd op tafel gelegd zonder te vragen of alles naar wens was. Ik ben gewoon een teleurgesteld in de hele ervaring en zo zie je maar hoeveel de service hier aan bijdraagt want aan de entourage en het eten lag het niet! Zou hierdoor wel minder snel terug komen.

Niet mijn idee van een rijsttafel delen, dat je naast in plaats van tegenover elkaar zit. Het personeel was vriendelijk, maar sprak geen Nederlands..het restaurant is duidelijk (te) veel op toeristen geend. Toen we hoorden dat er geen normale tafel beschikbaar was, zijn we weer vertrokken. De serveerster gaf aan dat we bij de reservering moeten aangeven dat we niet aan de bar willen zitten. Ik verwacht niet van een restaurant met naam en een bepaalde prijscategorie dat je aan de bar moet eten. Bij het weggaan zag ik op het kaartje van de jas dat je 1 euro per jas moet betalen, we hoefden dit niet te betalen, maar als dit normaal gesproken als dit echt zo is vind ik niet echt niet kunnen. Laatst bij Ron Blaauw aan de Sophialaan gegeten met gezelschap van bijna 50 man, shared dining. De wijn en dure flessen water bleven maar komen, maar we gingen met honger naar huis, paar hapjes delen met een hele tafel zonder opschepbestek is niet fijn (bij twee kippenbouten helemaal onmogelijk om te delen).

google_mybusiness,fra,-1,service;experience,"Une très très grosse déception..... ( 0 étoile ).Pour commencer, aucune amabilité de la part du personnel, une incompétence qui relève du défi quand il s'agit du service ""restaurant"" sachant que l'attente était longue...Les enfants sont servis bien après les adultes, on demande des pots de mayonnaise supplémentaires pour accompagner le burger et on nous fait comprendre qu'il faut tout finir et qu'il ne faut pas en recommander sous peine de déranger la ""cuisinière"",  on commande des bières avec le ""eat & play"" on nous amène des 50cl ( temps d'attente déjà long ) et nous ne prêtons particulièrement aucune attention sur le fait que ce soit des 33cl de base dans le menu (après tout, on nous les a amener ainsi). Plus tard, après 2 parties de bowling on commande à nouveau 3 bières en 50cl et cette fois, on nous amène deux 33cl et une 50cl. On expose le problème à la serveuse, à qui d'ailleurs on avait vraiment l'air de déranger (encore une fois...) et nous amène donc les deux autres pintes. Mon amie, ayant commandé un milkshake, retrouve un cheveu ou poil dedans, on redemande la serveuse et elle repars avec en cuisine et reviens 2 minutes après avec sûrement le même milkshake avec juste le poil en moins et avec de la chantilly par dessus pour cacher, je pense, le fait que ce soit l'ancien milkshake pour éviter d'en refaire un autre ce qui a empêcher mon amie de le boire, écoeurée... Puis s'ensuit le réglement de la note de toutes les boissons où là, on nous facture plus que ce que l'on croyait ; en effet "" les 50cl ne font pas partie du menu du coup on vous les fait payer au prix normal"" sans explications supplémentaires.. On répond que nous avions commandé des ""bierres"" avec sirop même, et non des pintes. La serveuse se défend en nous disant qu'elle connait son travail et que nous mentons en disant que nous n'avons pas commandé ""comme il fallait"". Le responsable prend part à la discussion, on lui explique les choses que l'on a remarqué, et nous cite exactement la même chose en défendant sa collègue sans même AUCUNES excuses de leur part sur TOUTES leurs erreurs que le personnel a effectué durant toute la soirée. Au final, on se tourne vers les jeux arcades et les billiards et vers 23h30 on voit l'agent de sécurité boucler les portes et venir nous regarder jouer au billiard.. mais dans le genre gênant ou on comprend mieux après deux ou trois paroles échangées avec lui pourquoi il était ainsi : On devait partir en gros... à 23h30 au lieu de 1h du matin. Je peux comprendre qu'on aime finir tôt dans ce travail, je travaille moi-même dans la restauration avec mes amis, mais de la à venir chercher les gens 1h30 avant la ferme pour leur faire comprendre de dégagez parce qu'on fait littéralement chier alors qu'un simple ""excusez-moi messieurs dames, nous allons bientôt fermer patati patata"" serait bien passé..Tout ca pour dire que je déconseille fortement vu le niveau très bas de l'accueil ainsi que du personnel. Bon courage..(Translated by Google)A very, very big disappointment ..... (0 stars).For starters, no friendliness on the part of the staff, incompetence that is a challenge when it comes to the service ""restaurant"" knowing that the wait was long ...The children are served well after the adults, we ask extra pots of mayonnaise to accompany the burger and we understand that we must finish everything and we must not recommend under penalty of disturbing the ""cook"", we order beers with the ""eat & play"" we get 50cl (waiting time already long) and we pay particularly no attention to the fact that it is a basic 33cl in the menu (after all, we have them to bring thus). Later, after 2 bowling games we order 3 beers again in 50cl and this time, we get two 33cl and a 50cl. We expose the problem to the waitress, who by the way we really seemed to disturb (again ...) and brings us the other two pints. My friend, having ordered a milkshake, finds a hair or hair in it, we ask for the waitress and she left with the kitchen and come back 2 minutes later with surely the same milkshake with just the hair less and with whipped cream over it to hide , I think, the fact that it is the old milkshake to avoid doing another one which prevented my friend from drinking it, disgusted ... Then follows the regulation of the note of all the drinks where there we are charged more than we thought; in fact ""the 50cl are not part of the menu suddenly you are paid at the normal price"" without further explanation .. It is answered that we ordered ""beers"" with syrup itself, not pints. The waitress defends herself by telling us that she knows her work and that we lie saying that we did not order ""properly"". The manager takes part in the discussion, explains the things that have been noticed, and quotes exactly the same thing by defending his colleague without even any excuses from them for ALL their mistakes that the staff made during the whole evening. In the end, we turn to arcade games and billiards and around 23:30 we see the security guard close the doors and come watch us play billiard .. but the kind embarrassing or we understand better after two or three words exchanged with him why it was so: We had to leave basically ... at 23:30 instead of 1am. I can understand that we like to finish early in this work, I work myself in the restaurant with my friends, but to come and get people 1:30 before the farm to make them understand to release because we literally lick while a simple ""excuse me ladies, we will soon close patati patata"" would be fine ..All this to say that I strongly recommend against the very low level of the reception and staff.Good luck.."

Bijna 5 euro voor een paar ajuintjes in deeg. 5 euro vr een glas wijn van een fles die zeker nog geen 3 euro heeft gekost. Het brood van de hamburger was koud, het vlees was gelijk een kauwgom, enkel chocomouse te verkrijgen als dessert op een zaterdag avond. Deze hamburger zou niet meer dan 8 euro mogen kosten. Laat staan het dubbele !! Heb 1 ster gegeven omdat minder niet kon. Als kok vond ik deze ervaring jammerlijk ! Iemand aanbevelen of terugkomen, nooit. Gezelligheid ook 0,0!!

We got drinks immediately but it took ages for our order to be taken and brought to us, making us feel like we were intentionally being made to wait so we'd order more drinks. When the food did came, the starter was very obviously microwaved (the plate was hotter than the food itself) and the main course (Crispy fried chicken burger) was not very well salted and not at all crispy. My dad used to take me to fridays in Greece when I was a teenager, and I have to say the quality of the food in Utrecht was much lower than what I had gotten used to.

google_mybusiness,nld,1,reputation;family_friendly;food;environment,"Degelijk hamburgerrestaurant. Dat is het concept. Het is meer restaurant dan een ""Five Guys"", maar de fast zit er zeker in. Standaard kan je tussen heel wat burgers kiezen, ook vis en vegetarisch. Let ook op de specials! Burgers eet je met of zonder friet, dat kies je zelf. Ook de bierkaart is ok. Niet enorm, maar meer dan een pils en tripel. Vroeger waren de frieten wedges, tegenwoordig standaard diepvriesalumettes. Persoonlijke keuze, maar ik had liever wedges. De kinderen hebben een propere en grote speelruimte achterin. Een volledige glaswand zorgt voor de gewenste inkijk. Voor een etentje met kinderen zeker een ++. Het uitzicht op het MAS en het Bonapartedok maken het een heel aangename locatie, overdag en 's avonds.(Translated by Google)Decent hamburger restaurant. That is the concept. It is more restaurant than a ""Five Guys"", but the fast is certainly in it. By default you can choose between many burgers, including fish and vegetarian. Also note the specials! You eat burgers with or without fries, you choose that yourself. The beer list is also ok. Not huge, but more than a beer and tripel. In the past, the fries were wedges, nowadays standard frozen alumettes. Personal choice, but I prefer wedges. The children have a clean and large play area in the back. A full glass wall provides the desired view. For a dinner with children, definitely a ++. The view of the MAS and the Bonaparte dock make it a very pleasant location during the day and in the evening."

formitable,eng,-1,food;service,"The food was very good, however we were very disappointed in the service. First, someone came to present the large steak for the table. The person had no knowledge of the type/cut of steaks available - only the breeds Angus or Holstein. Only 1 of the 3 steaks on your menu had the cut, the Tomahawk. That is not helpful in understanding the amount of fat, marbling, etc to share a huge steak for a table. Second, the steak took 2.5 hours to come out and arrived 1.5 hours after we finished our appetizers. I asked several times and the waiter said it's coming any minute. He never tried to help or seemed concerned with how dissatisfied we were. Not a good experience to wait that long for your mains to arrive with no food on the table. Third, I emailed about getting a dessert with sparklers/fireworks for the table for my wife's birthday. Your team emailed me that this would happen. The waiter forgot. I really would've loved to make my wife's birthday more special and show her I put some effort into celebrating it.Although the food was good, for a fine dining experience, I was extremely disappointed."

Y me he aliado con la competencia, las 🍕La BORGUESE, base bianca de crema trufada y mozzarella, speak ahumado y champiñones. 🍄 (casi siempre solemos pedir una con tomate y otra sin tomate para probar las dos) El precio es muy adecuado respecto a la calidad y cantidad, bajo mi punto de vista y recordando que no tengo fondo a la hora de comer, una pizza por persona, un entrante o postre para compartir estaría bien... los bordes son muy gorditos y blanditos, se comen! 🐽🤤Y más a mi favor, no hace falta reservar, a diferencia de todos los nuevos locales de Madrid, que como no lo hayas hecho cuatro días antes olvidate de tener mesa. Posiblemente esperéis unos 40/30 minutos (yo aún así siempre reservo en cualquier sitio) pero si no tenéis inconveniente en esperar, cabe esa opción. 🤟🏽"

Groot was mijn verbazing toen de serveerster het bestek neerlegde, zonder de tafel schoon te maken, dus wederom iemand geroepen. Ik was blij dat er iets vegans op de kaart stond. Echter, er was niet over nagedacht. Er zat geen kraak of smaak aan! Heb er maar peper en zout bij gevraagd. Eigenlijk wilden we nog taart als toetje, maar teleurgesteld zijn we maar vertrokken, nadat ik wederom iemand moest roepen om af te rekenen. Wat een ongezellige ervaring. Jammer, voor ons dan ook het laatste bezoek aan Dudok.

Nu nog even de website aanpassen.En ook: toen ik reserveerde kreeg ik de algemene voorwaarden voor de horeca toegestuurd, maar daarin al mijn financiële verplichtingen mocht ik afzeggen. Ik begrijp de frustratie van restaurants, zeker bij no-shows - maar voelde me als klant vooral gezien als risico.

formitable,eng,-1,food;service,- standing in a row at the entrance and host was seating people in front of us. Host could have made eye contact and let us know she is with us in a minute.- wardrobe looked messy when looking insight. Hangers where on the floor. - Setup at the bar with (dirty) iPad and pens looks messy and not very welcoming. - table number cards are inconsistent and some of the cards are dirty. Also the holder is rather big for the table. - soft drinks menu (ice teas) did not match stock. No sparkling green tea available but only balck which was not on the menu.- glasses got removed of the table. Waitress put the finger in the glass and back on the bar for reuse. Could have been done more hygienic with a tray. - food was good

Na drie x aan ons gevraagd te hebben wat we wilden drinken viel bij iemand het kwartje dat we eigenlijk champagne hadden besteld.

Daarnaast zaten we in een soort dode hoek waar de bediening iedere keer weer langs rende zonder oog voor ons te hebben. Ik lunch hier vaker, altijd met veel plezier maar 's avonds lijkt het alsof het te druk is voor ze. En ze deze drukte gewoon niet aankunnen.Ambiance is echt geweldig, live muziek, het glazen dak alles klopt  alleen het tempo en het aandachtsniveau mag omhoog."

Ook haar intrinsieke motivatie zorgt dat wij een hele leuke avond hebben gehad. We gingen met plezier beiden nog een keer naar de toilet om fragmenten van Jack van Gelder en de Luizenmoeder te horen.

Mais on nous dit que ça va se réparer donc on attend nos bières... En milieu de repas on nous amène une bouteille d'eau en gros pour nous faire comprendre que pour la bière c'est mort.Heureusement on a vue deux cruches de bières partir pour un groupe un peu plus loin...J'imagine qu'ils n'ont pas uniquement de la pression en bière ?!

C'est pas très professionnel...Vous faites des formules en semaine pour ramener des gens mais vous les faites fuir plus qu'autre chose...(Translated by Google)Clearly disappointed !!!We came to the base for the formula they advertise the ""Eat & Play"" on Monday and Tuesday evening ....We waited at least 30 minutes for the burgers while there was nobody (we understand better why finally ...).In addition, the draft beer has broken down, it happens in itself ... But we are told that it will be repaired so we wait for our beers ... In the middle of the meal we are brought a bottle of water wholesale to make us understand that for beer it's dead.Fortunately we saw two jugs of beer leaving for a group a little further ...I guess they do not just have beer pressure ?!

Wat fijn dat deze doelgroep een kans krijgt een leuke job te hebben in onze maatschappij. Ze doen hun werk met de grootste toewijding en vooral met veel plezier.Op de foto sta ik met het “grote tosti boek” wat je cadeau krijgt als je stempelkaart vol is.Dit mooie boek heeft bij mij een mooi plaatsje gekregen.De kans dat ik zelf een tosti ga maken is echter gering. Ik ga liever naar Happy Tosti om aldaar een tosti te nuttigen.Op de locatie waar Happy Tosti zich bevindt hebben overigens al heel wat tentjes gezeten welke vaak nog sneller weer weg waren dat ze zijn gekomen.Afgelopen week bestond Happy Tosti hun 3-jarige bestaan in Hoofddorp en dat is een felicitatie waard.Ik draag Happy Tosti, maar vooral de directie, een warm hart toe dat zij voor deze formule hebben gekozen.Ga zo door zou ik willen zeggen.- Ruud"
